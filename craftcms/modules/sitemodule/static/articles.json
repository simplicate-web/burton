      "description": "<p>Coming out of the 2002 Salt Lake Games, I wanted to give my game a new look. By that point, I had played in two Olympics and four World Championships. We were the best women&rsquo;s hockey team in the world. I was 24 and had realized many of my hockey dreams. That scared the shit out of me. A lot of people spend their entire lives chasing their goals&mdash;it gives them purpose, drive, and motivation every day. Something to work towards. What you don&rsquo;t hear about is what happens after.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve realized your dreams, then what? I was one of the game&rsquo;s best female players. I didn&rsquo;t feel challenged by my club team anymore and I was afraid of stagnating. How would I keep growing if I didn&rsquo;t feel challenged when I went to the rink? Was this it for me? Was this as far as I could go?</p>\n<p>Between Olympic years, I&rsquo;d been playing at the highest level for women in Canada, the original National Women&rsquo;s Hockey League (a senior women&rsquo;s league). It was amateur&mdash;we weren&rsquo;t being paid at all and in fact had to pay for our ice time&mdash;but it was where all the top players in Canada were. By 2002, I&rsquo;d been there for almost a decade and the level of competition felt easy to me. My club team was where I spent the majority of my time practising and playing between Olympics. But we practised only a couple times a week and we didn&rsquo;t play as many games in a season as I would have liked. I wanted to experience life as a professional hockey player, day in and day out, not only in Olympic years.</p>\n<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long to realize that I needed a creative solution. As an athlete, I was constantly assessing and reassessing the way I did things. I tracked the game&rsquo;s best players, both on the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s sides. I studied how they played and how they trained. I saw what the next level up in hockey looked like for me, and I knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t find it in the women&rsquo;s game in North America. I needed to find an opportunity for myself.</p>\n<p>At the same time as this restlessness set in, I was thinking about changing up my style of play. I wanted to rely less on my physical game and become more of a finesse player. I wanted to be less predictable. In my seven years with the Canadian national team, I had developed a power-focused style of play: I was bigger, stronger, and faster than my opponents and had been using my physicality to bend the game to my will, running over and shoving players off the puck. I played like a bull. Though that style had been working for me, I didn&rsquo;t want to depend on it alone. I wanted to be versatile. When you play one team as many times as we do the Americans, you get to know a player&rsquo;s habits, their weaknesses, the holes in their game. Team USA knew me inside and out by that point, and the next time we met, I wanted to surprise them. Instead of always being a bull, I wanted to become what Darryl Belfry calls a &ldquo;spider.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re a spider, the puck comes to you and through you. You don&rsquo;t need to haul the biscuit around the ice; it&rsquo;s following you around the rink. You&rsquo;re constantly engaging with it. You&rsquo;re finding seams, getting open, one-timing the puck to a winger in order to immediately get it back again. You&rsquo;re cycling in and out of the play. Rather than playing by force, you are forcing the play. Rather than doing it all yourself, you are creating opportunities for your team. If I built out my game so that I could be the bull or the spider, or something in between, the Americans would always be on their back foot trying to figure me out.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to get back to the mentality of being a rookie, being a seeker. Being the new one on the team requires a growth mindset; it&rsquo;s challenging, exciting, and a huge learning curve.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just about literally being the new person: it&rsquo;s a way of thinking where you&rsquo;re constantly looking for new ways to improve. I&rsquo;ve found that unless I&rsquo;m taking chances and pushing the envelope, I get antsy. I start to feel like I&rsquo;m not really living, like I&rsquo;m moving backwards. It spreads to other areas of my life, and I get grumpy and short-tempered. It&rsquo;s not good for me&mdash;or the people who have to live with me! I&rsquo;m restless when I feel my growth slowing down, when I am no longer learning something new every day. When I&rsquo;m growing, I&rsquo;m off-centre, unsure, playing catch-up&mdash;in a good way. I wanted to stop feeling comfortable, to be that rookie again who is asking questions and finding new approaches to my training and my game. I wanted to get back to being a seeker.</p>\n<p>So, in the fall of 2002, I set out to find somewhere to play men&rsquo;s pro hockey.</p>\n<p>My likeliest bet for a good fit was a league in Europe. It wasn&rsquo;t the easiest decision I&rsquo;ve ever made; I worried about leaving Canada and my family. Noah wasn&rsquo;t yet four, and I dreaded being away from him and the rest of my support system. I knew there would be anger and jealousy from some of my teammates and others in the women&rsquo;s game who wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate what I was doing. I knew I would be lambasted in the media. But larger than any of those downsides was my fear that if I just kept doing what I was doing, I would never get to see my potential through to the end. When I asked myself what I wanted to achieve, the answer was simple: I wanted to become the best hockey player that I could be. And I was willing to do whatever it took to achieve that. I knew I could play in a men&rsquo;s pro league; I didn&rsquo;t have any doubts that I wasn&rsquo;t good enough. For the previous two summers I had spent time in the Czech Republic, practising and training with HC Energie Karlovy Vary, a top-tier team. It was only for a couple of months at a time, but it had shown me that I could compete with those players at that level. Now I wanted to do it for an entire season.</p>\n<p>Initially, I had my heart set on playing the 2003 season in Italy. I had a great contract lined up with the Merano Eagles and was just a signature away from earning a solid salary as an import player. That would have been huge for me; aside from some carding money from Team Canada, I had never been paid to play before. But this plan stopped at the paperwork stage: the Italian Ice Hockey Federation refused to register me. They said that women could play on a men&rsquo;s team only if no parallel women&rsquo;s league existed. Because there were senior women&rsquo;s leagues in Canada, they considered those parallel and argued that I should stay there. The league president was more direct with Canadian media, telling the CBC that he felt the whole thing was a publicity stunt. I was disappointed. So was Merano&rsquo;s coach, Paul Theriault, a Canadian from Sault Ste. Marie who was familiar with my game. Theriault knew I had the talent to play in that league, and he had a role carved out for me with the Eagles. The team&rsquo;s management was prepared to challenge the federation&rsquo;s ruling on my behalf, but I knew it was a lost cause. The powers-that-be were dead set against me playing in Italy, and I knew they weren&rsquo;t going to reverse course. I told the Eagles not to bother appealing the decision and I kept searching for a team and league that wanted me. A German team expressed interest in me, but the league didn&rsquo;t feel like the right fit. NHL legend Phil Esposito approached my agent with an offer for a 15-game tryout with the Cincinnati Cyclones of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). Today, the ECHL is a solid NHL feeder league. But 20 years ago, it had a reputation for being a goon league. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in that style of play and didn&rsquo;t think it would advance my goal of becoming a spider. I imagined everyone in that league would focus on running me over. If I wanted to become more versatile, I needed to be around skills- focused players.</p>\n<p>I joined HC Salamat in Suomi-sarja, Finland&rsquo;s third division, centring the team&rsquo;s third line. Moving to suburban Kirkkonummi, outside of Helsinki, was a huge culture shock, which was heightened by moving there solo. Noah was able to come to Finland a few times with our nanny, Janice, and my sister, Jane. But mostly I was alone in a small town on the Baltic Sea, surrounded by people who spoke a different language from me and ate things I&rsquo;d never heard of before&mdash;cabbage rolls and pickled herring and fish pies!</p>\n<p>Winters in Finland can be rough. I was living north of the 60th parallel, about the same latitude as Anchorage, Alaska. When I left for the gym in the morning, it was dark. I&rsquo;d go to the rink in the afternoon and it would be dark. I&rsquo;d come out of the rink in the evening and it would be dark. The skies were a decent match for my mood.</p>\n<p>I was attracting a fair bit of attention. Media was even showing up for Salamat practices. But head coach Matti Hagman, who had played for the Edmonton Oilers in the late &rsquo;70s, didn&rsquo;t exactly roll out the welcome mat for me. At my first practice, he assigned a six-foot-four defenceman to hound me and take runs at me. Every time he drilled me, I picked myself up off the ice and moved on to the next drill, knowing it would happen again and again all practice long. What else could I do? He never let up. After two weeks, Matti finally called him off. &ldquo;I had to do that,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I wanted the media to see you could handle the hitting.&rdquo; A lot of people thought my move to Finland was a publicity stunt. It was frustrating. I stood to gain nothing from a bit of extra press. It wasn&rsquo;t like sponsors were falling all over themselves to sign female hockey players in 2003. (Or today, for that matter.) My choice had nothing to do with media attention or breaking barriers. I was there to take my game to the next level. It was a hard thing for people on the outside to understand. I couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a more dramatic situation to force me to stop playing like a bull. I was suddenly one of the smaller players on the ice. I couldn&rsquo;t run over opponents anymore&mdash;most of them were bigger and stronger than me. I wasn&rsquo;t able to use pure power to get the puck. The switch to full-contact hockey also forced me to change how I saw the ice; I needed to play with eyes in the back of my head, especially as a centre coming up the middle. Full contact means you can&rsquo;t just follow the puck, you have to always know what is coming at you.</p>\n<p>One bad hit could end my career.</p>\n<p>I was forced to become a spider. I still went hard into the corners. I threw checks. I played tough, but I started relying more on my intelligence than my brute strength, replacing slapshots with quicker, smart shots and executing creative passes. The bull was slowly disappearing.</p>\n<p>I finished the season with Salamat&rsquo;s best faceoff numbers and became the first woman to score in men&rsquo;s pro, with two goals and 10 assists over 23 games. Even better, Salamat moved up to Finland&rsquo;s second division. After returning to Canada in between, I played a further 17 games with the team the following season, logging seven more goals and six assists. When I got back to Alberta, I decided to surprise Noah. My flight got in around midnight. I kneeled down beside his bed and rubbed his back until he woke up. &ldquo;Mommy, you&rsquo;re home!&rdquo; he said, grabbing me in a tight hug. He didn&rsquo;t stop talking for the next two hours.</p>\n<p>He needed to catch me up on everything he was learning about dinosaurs and the latest daycare gossip. The experience was tough on me and my family. But nothing could have been better for my game. When I rejoined my old team in Calgary, I was able to read the ice much more quickly. I had so much more time and space. I brought a new patience and poise to my game. There had been a lot of dark, lonely days, but it was worth it. Those two seasons in Finland were two of the best of my hockey career.</p>\n<p>You grow by taking chances. You reach your dreams by challenging yourself. When I look back at 2002 now, I see that I had two clear choices: I could stay where I was comfortable, or I could seek out an entirely new challenge and find out who I could become. Nothing about it was easy, but it was one of the best decisions I ever made. Being a seeker is a mindset, one that forces you to grow.</p>\n<p>I never settled for safe. I never did what had been done before. If I was getting sick of the gym, I got outside. If I was getting bored or complacent, I changed things up. And I never trained with my equals, not if I could help it. I worked out with people who were bigger, stronger, or faster, or who had something new to teach me. It&rsquo;s the best way to improve. It forces you to work harder and think faster because you&rsquo;re always chasing them, you&rsquo;re always playing catch-up.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><em>Excerpted from Over the Boards by Hayley Wickenheiser.

It spreads to other areas of my life, and I get grumpy and short-tempered. It&rsquo;s not good for me&mdash;or the people who have to live with me! I&rsquo;m restless when I feel my growth slowing down, when I am no longer learning something new every day. When I&rsquo;m growing, I&rsquo;m off-centre, unsure, playing catch-up&mdash;in a good way. I wanted to stop feeling comfortable, to be that rookie again who is asking questions and finding new approaches to my training and my game. I wanted to get back to being a seeker.</p>\n<p>So, in the fall of 2002, I set out to find somewhere to play men&rsquo;s pro hockey.</p>\n<p>My likeliest bet for a good fit was a league in Europe. It wasn&rsquo;t the easiest decision I&rsquo;ve ever made; I worried about leaving Canada and my family. Noah wasn&rsquo;t yet four, and I dreaded being away from him and the rest of my support system. I knew there would be anger and jealousy from some of my teammates and others in the women&rsquo;s game who wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate what I was doing. I knew I would be lambasted in the media. But larger than any of those downsides was my fear that if I just kept doing what I was doing, I would never get to see my potential through to the end. When I asked myself what I wanted to achieve, the answer was simple: I wanted to become the best hockey player that I could be. And I was willing to do whatever it took to achieve that. I knew I could play in a men&rsquo;s pro league; I didn&rsquo;t have any doubts that I wasn&rsquo;t good enough. For the previous two summers I had spent time in the Czech Republic, practising and training with HC Energie Karlovy Vary, a top-tier team. It was only for a couple of months at a time, but it had shown me that I could compete with those players at that level. Now I wanted to do it for an entire season.</p>\n<p>Initially, I had my heart set on playing the 2003 season in Italy. I had a great contract lined up with the Merano Eagles and was just a signature away from earning a solid salary as an import player. That would have been huge for me; aside from some carding money from Team Canada, I had never been paid to play before. But this plan stopped at the paperwork stage: the Italian Ice Hockey Federation refused to register me. They said that women could play on a men&rsquo;s team only if no parallel women&rsquo;s league existed. Because there were senior women&rsquo;s leagues in Canada, they considered those parallel and argued that I should stay there. The league president was more direct with Canadian media, telling the CBC that he felt the whole thing was a publicity stunt. I was disappointed. So was Merano&rsquo;s coach, Paul Theriault, a Canadian from Sault Ste. Marie who was familiar with my game. Theriault knew I had the talent to play in that league, and he had a role carved out for me with the Eagles. The team&rsquo;s management was prepared to challenge the federation&rsquo;s ruling on my behalf, but I knew it was a lost cause. The powers-that-be were dead set against me playing in Italy, and I knew they weren&rsquo;t going to reverse course. I told the Eagles not to bother appealing the decision and I kept searching for a team and league that wanted me. A German team expressed interest in me, but the league didn&rsquo;t feel like the right fit. NHL legend Phil Esposito approached my agent with an offer for a 15-game tryout with the Cincinnati Cyclones of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). Today, the ECHL is a solid NHL feeder league. But 20 years ago, it had a reputation for being a goon league. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in that style of play and didn&rsquo;t think it would advance my goal of becoming a spider. I imagined everyone in that league would focus on running me over. If I wanted to become more versatile, I needed to be around skills- focused players.</p>\n<p>I joined HC Salamat in Suomi-sarja, Finland&rsquo;s third division, centring the team&rsquo;s third line. Moving to suburban Kirkkonummi, outside of Helsinki, was a huge culture shock, which was heightened by moving there solo. Noah was able to come to Finland a few times with our nanny, Janice, and my sister, Jane. But mostly I was alone in a small town on the Baltic Sea, surrounded by people who spoke a different language from me and ate things I&rsquo;d never heard of before&mdash;cabbage rolls and pickled herring and fish pies!</p>\n<p>Winters in Finland can be rough. I was living north of the 60th parallel, about the same latitude as Anchorage, Alaska. When I left for the gym in the morning, it was dark. I&rsquo;d go to the rink in the afternoon and it would be dark. I&rsquo;d come out of the rink in the evening and it would be dark. The skies were a decent match for my mood.</p>\n<p>I was attracting a fair bit of attention. Media was even showing up for Salamat practices. But head coach Matti Hagman, who had played for the Edmonton Oilers in the late &rsquo;70s, didn&rsquo;t exactly roll out the welcome mat for me. At my first practice, he assigned a six-foot-four defenceman to hound me and take runs at me. Every time he drilled me, I picked myself up off the ice and moved on to the next drill, knowing it would happen again and again all practice long. What else could I do? He never let up. After two weeks, Matti finally called him off. &ldquo;I had to do that,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I wanted the media to see you could handle the hitting.&rdquo; A lot of people thought my move to Finland was a publicity stunt. It was frustrating. I stood to gain nothing from a bit of extra press. It wasn&rsquo;t like sponsors were falling all over themselves to sign female hockey players in 2003. (Or today, for that matter.) My choice had nothing to do with media attention or breaking barriers. I was there to take my game to the next level. It was a hard thing for people on the outside to understand. I couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a more dramatic situation to force me to stop playing like a bull. I was suddenly one of the smaller players on the ice. I couldn&rsquo;t run over opponents anymore&mdash;most of them were bigger and stronger than me. I wasn&rsquo;t able to use pure power to get the puck. The switch to full-contact hockey also forced me to change how I saw the ice; I needed to play with eyes in the back of my head, especially as a centre coming up the middle. Full contact means you can&rsquo;t just follow the puck, you have to always know what is coming at you.</p>\n<p>One bad hit could end my career.</p>\n<p>I was forced to become a spider. I still went hard into the corners. I threw checks. I played tough, but I started relying more on my intelligence than my brute strength, replacing slapshots with quicker, smart shots and executing creative passes. The bull was slowly disappearing.</p>\n<p>I finished the season with Salamat&rsquo;s best faceoff numbers and became the first woman to score in men&rsquo;s pro, with two goals and 10 assists over 23 games. Even better, Salamat moved up to Finland&rsquo;s second division. After returning to Canada in between, I played a further 17 games with the team the following season, logging seven more goals and six assists. When I got back to Alberta, I decided to surprise Noah. My flight got in around midnight. I kneeled down beside his bed and rubbed his back until he woke up. &ldquo;Mommy, you&rsquo;re home!&rdquo; he said, grabbing me in a tight hug. He didn&rsquo;t stop talking for the next two hours.</p>\n<p>He needed to catch me up on everything he was learning about dinosaurs and the latest daycare gossip. The experience was tough on me and my family. But nothing could have been better for my game. When I rejoined my old team in Calgary, I was able to read the ice much more quickly. I had so much more time and space. I brought a new patience and poise to my game. There had been a lot of dark, lonely days, but it was worth it. Those two seasons in Finland were two of the best of my hockey career.</p>\n<p>You grow by taking chances. You reach your dreams by challenging yourself. When I look back at 2002 now, I see that I had two clear choices: I could stay where I was comfortable, or I could seek out an entirely new challenge and find out who I could become. Nothing about it was easy, but it was one of the best decisions I ever made. Being a seeker is a mindset, one that forces you to grow.</p>\n<p>I never settled for safe. I never did what had been done before. If I was getting sick of the gym, I got outside. If I was getting bored or complacent, I changed things up. And I never trained with my equals, not if I could help it. I worked out with people who were bigger, stronger, or faster, or who had something new to teach me. It&rsquo;s the best way to improve. It forces you to work harder and think faster because you&rsquo;re always chasing them, you&rsquo;re always playing catch-up.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><em>Excerpted from Over the Boards by Hayley Wickenheiser.

      "description": "<p>As the courier at the door hands over a package, he blurts out a few words. &ldquo;Oh my God, it&rsquo;s you! I thought I recognized your name. I miss watching you on the news.&rdquo; Lisa LaFlamme&mdash;former national news anchor, silver-haired cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre, woman in the midst of a regeneration&mdash;tilts her head graciously. She hears this a lot. At the dog park. At the bakery.</p>\n<p>She says &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; because what else is there to say? That camera has switched off. Last August, she posted a video on Twitter telling viewers that she was no longer anchor of CTV National News, because parent company Bell Media had terminated her contract. She said that she was &ldquo;saddened&rdquo; and &ldquo;blindsided.&rdquo; Bell called it a &ldquo;business decision,&rdquo; a particularly cold-blooded description of axing a 58-year-old woman at the height of her career.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, she has maintained a dignified silence, partly due to the terms of her departure and partly because she doesn&rsquo;t want to speculate about the underlying causes that might have led to her firing. But mainly because she wants to move on. She has things to do, stories to tell.</p>\n<p>When she comes back into her living room carrying the parcel (containing her copy of Prince Harry&rsquo;s Spare), she mentions how much it means to her to hear this affection from ordinary people. At her heels are her chocolate Labs&mdash;eight-month-old Millie, a bundle of energy, and 13-year-old Toby, sedately lumbering. In the midtown Toronto home she shares with her partner, former Toronto Star editor Michael Cooke, she walks past the shelf holding her 12 Canadian Screen Awards. The dull winter light catches her bright grey hair.</p>\n<p>You didn&rsquo;t think we could do this without talking about LaFlamme&rsquo;s hair, did you? The silver bob that was the locus of the country&rsquo;s outrage last summer? The sleek mane that displaced Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s as the most famous mop in the country and ignited an international debate about sexism and ageism?</p>\n<p>LaFlamme sits down, sighs. She&rsquo;s reported from war zones and natural disasters, interviewed presidents and tycoons. She worked for CTV for 35 years and anchored the nightly news for 11. No one that accomplished wants to be reduced to the strands sprouting out of their scalp. When talking about it, a twinge of something&mdash;discomfort? dark humour?&mdash;crosses her face. She says, &ldquo;Any journalist is uncomfortable becoming the story instead of reporting on it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But every journalist is also fascinated by a juicy story, and this is one. To begin at the beginning: Shortly after LaFlamme&rsquo;s ouster, The Globe and Mail&rsquo;s Robyn Doolittle reported that CTV News&rsquo; new-at-the-time boss Michael Melling had asked at a meeting who had approved the decision to &ldquo;let Lisa&rsquo;s hair go grey.&rdquo; For fans reading between the lines, the implication was clear: Executives believed that no one wanted to see a woman aging naturally on television. An international furor ensued, with CNN correspondents discussing the gendered politics of dye, and Wendy&rsquo;s Canada draining the colour from the red-headed girl on its corporate logo.</p>\n<p>LaFlamme has no idea if her hair played any role in Bell&rsquo;s decision. But she is very animated on the subject of the role hair plays in the life of every anchorwoman. Early in her career, when she was up for an on-air job at Global News, a male executive told her she&rsquo;d get nowhere with &ldquo;that hair.&rdquo; At the time it was dark, thick and curly. (Ladies, you can never win.)</p>\n<p>She&rsquo;d started to go grey at 18, and by the time she was an anchor, colouring became a second job. She&rsquo;d dyed her hair in a military bathroom in Kandahar. Her go-bag often contained hair-care products. During the pandemic, when her salon was closed, she was waking up to find her pillow smeared with the residue of at-home root touch-up. This worshipping at the temple of hair had become too much. And it had nothing to do with what she was really interested in: telling the stories of the people caught up in the news.</p>\n<p>In the first year of the pandemic, exhausted with her own Sisyphean struggle with Nice &lsquo;N Easy, LaFlamme told her boss she was going to go grey. She had the support of her boss, and so she let it grow out. The response from viewers was overwhelming. &ldquo;Ninety-eight percent of it was positive,&rdquo; LaFlamme says. &ldquo;It was so liberating.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>LaFlamme has long been a critic of sexism in journalism&mdash;in all industries, really. This advocacy is not new, she points out, and predates her departure from CTV. She notes that a group of female friends who are her contemporaries have left the television industry in the past few years, leaving for radio or other, less public-facing areas of journalism.</p>\n<p>LaFlamme won&rsquo;t speak about her termination, but others are happy to step into the vacuum. An open letter signed by more than 70 high-profile supporters like Louise Penny and Jann Arden slammed the &ldquo;sexism and ageism&rdquo; of Bell&rsquo;s decision. And LaFlamme&rsquo;s friends and colleagues have expressed dismay that a career filled with highlights ended on such a low note. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met anyone who worked harder,&rdquo; says her friend and former producer Alison Redmond. &ldquo;For her, the story is everything.&rdquo; When she heard that LaFlamme had been fired, &ldquo;I was absolutely shocked and saddened and angry. Lisa&rsquo;s numbers, the ratings for her show, surpassed everybody else&rsquo;s. I was just gobsmacked by the news.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This past April, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television gave LaFlamme its Gordon Sinclair Award for her &ldquo;exceptional body of work in journalism.&rdquo; (You have to give the Academy props for this subtle shade cast at CTV, given that Sinclair was a broadcaster whose irascibility and silver comb-over did not stand in the way of success. Like Sinclair, LaFlamme is also an Officer of the Order of Canada.)</p>\n<p>LaFlamme, calmly sailing above the wreckage, has her eyes on other horizons. She is an advocate for women in her industry, but equally important&mdash;possibly more important&mdash;is her advocacy for women around the world. &ldquo;So much of my focus is on the women and girls who are oppressed&mdash;like in Afghanistan, Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the countries that are very close to me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That is where our energy needs to be directed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If you ask LaFlamme which stories struck a particular emotional chord, she mentions being in a tent in Northern Iraq with a group of Yazidi women, one of whom showed her most treasured possession: a photo on her iPhone of her daughter, who was being held as a sex slave by ISIS forces. Those are the stories, overlooked by the rest of the world, she still wants to tell.</p>\n<p>When we chat, she&rsquo;s a few weeks out from a trip to Kenya, Tunisia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to showcase reporters working on stories about gender-based violence. She&rsquo;ll be making mini-documentaries for Journalists for Human Rights, concentrating on reporters like one in Goma she met in the past, who had to sleep in her newsroom at night because it was too dangerous to leave. In the morning, the reporter would sneak home to breastfeed her baby.</p>\n<p>When LaFlamme was a child in Kitchener, Ont., growing up in a house with three sisters, she dreamed of telling stories. In Grade 9, she told her guidance counsellor she wanted to be a journalist &ldquo;even though I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what a journalist did.&rdquo; This last observation, and many others, is followed with a long, throaty laugh.</p>\n<p>After a couple of years spent in France working as an au pair and interning at a radio station on the side, she returned to enroll in communications at the University of Ottawa. Back in Kitchener, LaFlamme got a job working in the CKCO newsroom, the local affiliate of CTV. One day, she got a call from Henry Kowalski, the head of CTV.</p>\n<p>The network was launching a 24-hour news channel. Would she like to come down and audition? Of course she would. LaFlamme, a self-described clothes horse, wore a sky-blue blazer to the audition and went &ldquo;full Albert Brooks,&rdquo; sweating like a ham at a picnic. Another full-bodied laugh. Despite the blazer mishap, she aced the audition, and a series of choice opportunities arose: parliamentary reporter, consumer advocate, co-host of Canada AM, CTV&rsquo;s national morning show.</p>\n<p>LaFlamme&rsquo;s second day at Canada AM was Sept. 11, 2001. After the Twin Towers fell, she hopped in a car with a producer, driving all the way to lower Manhattan, where they choked on the acrid air and were nearly arrested for trespassing. They reported around the clock for a week.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve covered sudden change my whole career,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This was mine. And there&rsquo;s no comparison to the sudden change I&rsquo;d covered. There&rsquo;s no coming back from getting your legs blown off in Afghanistan, or an earthquake wiping out your family.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For the past several months, life has offered an unexpected gift: the luxury of time to think about the future without worrying about when the next plane departs. She&rsquo;s fielding offers and having conversations and doing things &ldquo;that feed me emotionally,&rdquo; like helping Afghan friends who are now living in Canada. She took part in a fundraiser for the charity Dress for Success, and interviewed Auschwitz survivor Angela Orosz at Montreal&rsquo;s Holocaust Museum.</p>\n<p>In September, when LaFlamme heard the Queen had died, she was at her cottage. Here it was, the biggest story, the one she&rsquo;d trained for&mdash;and she had nowhere to go. No microphone to hold. She got in the car to head back to the city and said to Cooke, &ldquo;I need to find a job between here and Toronto.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By that evening, she was on a plane to London with her producer friend, Redmond, who is now a freelancer. Citytv in Toronto hired them to cover the Queen&rsquo;s funeral, and they produced daily coverage as well as a seven-hour special. &ldquo;The networks had decades to prepare, and we had days,&rdquo; LaFlamme says with a laugh. &ldquo;But when you know how to do something, you just figure it out. It was an amazing experience.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For Redmond, it was a chance to work with an old friend&mdash;and to witness a phenomenon that takes place not just on LaFlamme&rsquo;s doorstep, but in far-flung cities as well. &ldquo;Everywhere we went, and I mean everywhere, people would stop us and say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re from Vancouver, we&rsquo;re from St. John&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re from Halifax. We miss you,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;&lsquo;We wish you were still on the air.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Those fans in London, and the ones across Canada, don&rsquo;t have to worry. There are stories to be told. And someone&mdash;let&rsquo;s say someone seasoned and mature and capable&mdash;is very keen to keep telling them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><em>This profile originally appeared on Chatelaine.com.

After the Twin Towers fell, she hopped in a car with a producer, driving all the way to lower Manhattan, where they choked on the acrid air and were nearly arrested for trespassing. They reported around the clock for a week.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve covered sudden change my whole career,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;This was mine. And there&rsquo;s no comparison to the sudden change I&rsquo;d covered. There&rsquo;s no coming back from getting your legs blown off in Afghanistan, or an earthquake wiping out your family.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For the past several months, life has offered an unexpected gift: the luxury of time to think about the future without worrying about when the next plane departs. She&rsquo;s fielding offers and having conversations and doing things &ldquo;that feed me emotionally,&rdquo; like helping Afghan friends who are now living in Canada. She took part in a fundraiser for the charity Dress for Success, and interviewed Auschwitz survivor Angela Orosz at Montreal&rsquo;s Holocaust Museum.</p>\n<p>In September, when LaFlamme heard the Queen had died, she was at her cottage. Here it was, the biggest story, the one she&rsquo;d trained for&mdash;and she had nowhere to go. No microphone to hold. She got in the car to head back to the city and said to Cooke, &ldquo;I need to find a job between here and Toronto.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By that evening, she was on a plane to London with her producer friend, Redmond, who is now a freelancer. Citytv in Toronto hired them to cover the Queen&rsquo;s funeral, and they produced daily coverage as well as a seven-hour special. &ldquo;The networks had decades to prepare, and we had days,&rdquo; LaFlamme says with a laugh. &ldquo;But when you know how to do something, you just figure it out. It was an amazing experience.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For Redmond, it was a chance to work with an old friend&mdash;and to witness a phenomenon that takes place not just on LaFlamme&rsquo;s doorstep, but in far-flung cities as well. &ldquo;Everywhere we went, and I mean everywhere, people would stop us and say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re from Vancouver, we&rsquo;re from St. John&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re from Halifax. We miss you,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;&lsquo;We wish you were still on the air.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Those fans in London, and the ones across Canada, don&rsquo;t have to worry. There are stories to be told. And someone&mdash;let&rsquo;s say someone seasoned and mature and capable&mdash;is very keen to keep telling them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><em>This profile originally appeared on Chatelaine.com.

That elevated energy could push us into a couple of different directions. Researchers at Harvard took a deeper look at what happens when we&rsquo;re faced with a stimulus that can create those butterflies. Participants were asked to belt out a tune in front of a group and according to a computer that measured volume and pitch, those who told themselves &ldquo;I am excited&rdquo; outperformed those who told themselves &ldquo;I am anxious&rdquo; and those who told themselves nothing. They even outperformed the others on a math and speech test. You can be your own worst enemy if you focus on those negative feelings. But you can psych yourself up instead of psyching yourself out! By turning your anxiety into excitement, you can change your brain and get better results! If you can improve your performance on a math test, imagine what you can do for yourself in a negotiation by simply telling yourself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited to create a solution to this problem&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited to get what I want!&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Reframe defeat with one word</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to psych yourself out and think &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been able to deal with this person.&rdquo; Such definitive language closes a door. But one word can turn it around and open a door. Adding the word &ldquo;yet&rdquo; can open a world of possibilities and a challenge for you instead of an obstacle.

What will the other party say or do? There are a million unknowns, but a better use of your energy is using it to prepare. Put that attention into what you do know. Do a little research to minimize the unknowns. What data could you look up? What do you know about the person you&rsquo;re about to encounter? What is predictable about this situation so you can anticipate and prevent some of the drama&mdash;or at least not be shocked when it comes. And even practice what you want to say so that your brain is familiar with what is going to come out of your mouth, and you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re stumbling over your words.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflect on past victories</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to worry about what could go wrong but it&rsquo;s even easier to focus on some past victories. Everything from a high school basketball game to that time you got your toddler to eat something green. If you can succeed in those circumstances, you&rsquo;re certainly capable of succeeding again.

If you can see it, you can achieve it so picture yourself standing up tall and sounding as confident as you need to get it done. Those positive visual images will settle in your subconscious brain and start pushing you in the direction of achieving that goal without you even realizing it. Take it a step further and engage the other senses, imagine what it will smell like when you walk out of the room victorious or the taste of that first sip of a celebratory cocktail. Relish in that feeling and your brain will get a nice buzz to get you a little closer to that moment.

Whether it&rsquo;s telling yourself that &ldquo;I deserve this&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am going to conquer this moment&rdquo; you choose.

It&rsquo;s easy for our subconscious to take the easy negative road of worry and anxiety so engage your conscious brain to help take up that space.</p>\n<p>It may seem daunting to go after what you want.

      "description": "<p>We are living in an era of disruption and exponential change requiring innovation, adaptability, new and diverse skills for communication and collaboration. At the same time, the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies stress, loneliness, and anxiety as epidemics of our modern world. These all directly impede innovation, connection, critical thinking, and achievement.</p>\n<p>Technology is further changing daily life, societal norms, and the inner workings of the human brain, influencing attitudes, beliefs, and the geo-political landscape like never before. So how then, can we successfully develop the new skill set required for success in our rapidly changing, globally competitive, and tech-driven modern world?</p>\n<p>We must rethink the previous paradigms of wellness, culture, and success. Research indicates several identifiable challenges and opportunities in our ever-changing world. Here they are and how the science of your three brains will help you navigate each one.</p>\n<p>All humans are hardwired for health, happiness, adaptability, and peak performance. We must integrate more social emotional cognitive practices into our daily lives to move towards the deep, powerful, and innate utilization of our own incredible brains.</p>\n<p><strong>Global trend #1: Stress &amp; burnout.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Emotional Skills for resilience &amp; wellness</strong></p>\n<p>The human body has a &ldquo;gut brain&rdquo; that is sensitive to the primal emotion of fear and insecurity. That is why children get tummy aches when they are scared, and adults may experience nausea/loose stools before an important presentation. When we are stressed, too busy, or even just &ldquo;multitasking&rdquo; (which by the way, does not exist), our nervous system wonders what is wrong, why can&rsquo;t we rest or focus and kicks our stress response into gear. Mindfulness activities such as observing nature, gratitude journaling, breathing practice, and meditation release endorphins and move our nervous systems from stress to growth. Simply valuing downtime, unplugging, taking a break from life, and specific practices to regulate stress, busyness and distraction are powerful effective life skills all humans immediately need to learn, master and practice daily.</p>\n<p><strong>Global trend #2: Disconnection &amp; polarization</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Social Skills for communication &amp; collaboration</strong></p>\n<p>The heart has a brain! The human heart has specialized sensory neurites that are intelligent and the heart releases either adrenal under social stress/disconnection or the powerful neurohormone of love, bonding, and trust &ndash; oxytocin when socially connected. Our heart brain is our true &ldquo;control center&rdquo; as we humans are fundamentally social beings making the quality of our relationships vital to our wellbeing and success. We must remember that socializing, social status and social media are different from social bonding &ndash; true meaningful relationships with others. We must nurture vital social skills such as empathy, healthy assertiveness, perspective taking, and positive communication to strengthen and repair our own self-connection and bonds with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Global trend #3: Anxiety &amp; perfectionism</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Cognitive Skills of adaptability, and innovation.</strong></p>\n<p>Our big brain in our head loves to play! This means that our highly sophisticated prefrontal cortex is motivated, powered and strengthened through trying new things, exploration, and learning through trial and error. By adopting a &ldquo;play mindset&rdquo; we can combat rising perfectionism which is linked to anxiety, depression, and lower achievement. Play is about being comfortable with uncertainty, making mistakes, adapting, and innovating. We do this through brainstorming, experimenting, iterating. These activities release serotonin &ndash; our neurochemical of mastery, confidence, and creativity.</p>",

          "textOnly": "<p>We are living in an era of disruption and exponential change requiring innovation, adaptability, new and diverse skills for communication and collaboration. At the same time, the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies stress, loneliness, and anxiety as epidemics of our modern world. These all directly impede innovation, connection, critical thinking, and achievement.</p>\n<p>Technology is further changing daily life, societal norms, and the inner workings of the human brain, influencing attitudes, beliefs, and the geo-political landscape like never before. So how then, can we successfully develop the new skill set required for success in our rapidly changing, globally competitive, and tech-driven modern world?</p>\n<p>We must rethink the previous paradigms of wellness, culture, and success. Research indicates several identifiable challenges and opportunities in our ever-changing world. Here they are and how the science of your three brains will help you navigate each one.</p>\n<p>All humans are hardwired for health, happiness, adaptability, and peak performance. We must integrate more social emotional cognitive practices into our daily lives to move towards the deep, powerful, and innate utilization of our own incredible brains.</p>\n<p><strong>Global trend #1: Stress &amp; burnout.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Emotional Skills for resilience &amp; wellness</strong></p>\n<p>The human body has a &ldquo;gut brain&rdquo; that is sensitive to the primal emotion of fear and insecurity. That is why children get tummy aches when they are scared, and adults may experience nausea/loose stools before an important presentation. When we are stressed, too busy, or even just &ldquo;multitasking&rdquo; (which by the way, does not exist), our nervous system wonders what is wrong, why can&rsquo;t we rest or focus and kicks our stress response into gear. Mindfulness activities such as observing nature, gratitude journaling, breathing practice, and meditation release endorphins and move our nervous systems from stress to growth. Simply valuing downtime, unplugging, taking a break from life, and specific practices to regulate stress, busyness and distraction are powerful effective life skills all humans immediately need to learn, master and practice daily.</p>\n<p><strong>Global trend #2: Disconnection &amp; polarization</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Social Skills for communication &amp; collaboration</strong></p>\n<p>The heart has a brain! The human heart has specialized sensory neurites that are intelligent and the heart releases either adrenal under social stress/disconnection or the powerful neurohormone of love, bonding, and trust &ndash; oxytocin when socially connected. Our heart brain is our true &ldquo;control center&rdquo; as we humans are fundamentally social beings making the quality of our relationships vital to our wellbeing and success. We must remember that socializing, social status and social media are different from social bonding &ndash; true meaningful relationships with others. We must nurture vital social skills such as empathy, healthy assertiveness, perspective taking, and positive communication to strengthen and repair our own self-connection and bonds with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Global trend #3: Anxiety &amp; perfectionism</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Solution: Cognitive Skills of adaptability, and innovation.</strong></p>\n<p>Our big brain in our head loves to play! This means that our highly sophisticated prefrontal cortex is motivated, powered and strengthened through trying new things, exploration, and learning through trial and error. By adopting a &ldquo;play mindset&rdquo; we can combat rising perfectionism which is linked to anxiety, depression, and lower achievement. Play is about being comfortable with uncertainty, making mistakes, adapting, and innovating. We do this through brainstorming, experimenting, iterating. These activities release serotonin &ndash; our neurochemical of mastery, confidence, and creativity.</p>"

This frequently referenced publication, now in its eighth year of reporting on this important issue, also highlights top companies achieving gender parity on boards and executive officer roles.</p>\n<p>Osler started tracking diversity-related data on the TSX in 2015 when securities regulators amended laws to require public companies listed on the Toronto exchange to disclose gender diversity on boards and in senior leadership positions. The objective is to update the data, presenting an annual snapshot each year of how issuers are making progress. The report also provides a roadmap for companies to help guide them on the journey to building their own talent pipelines and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in their organizations.</p>\n<p>Last year, the authors of the report, Andrew MacDougall, partner in the Corporate group, John Valley, Chair of the firm&rsquo;s ESG practice, and Jennifer Jeffrey, associate in the Corporate group, saw that significant progress had been made in the number of women on boards and senior leadership positions since the launch of the first Diversity Disclosure Practices report in 2015. However, representation from visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities is still lacking.</p>\n<p>This is a significant change from 2015 when women represented, on average, 10% of directors at TSX companies. As well, the number of TSX companies with more than 50% women directors on their boards almost doubled from the previous year.</p>\n<p>Looking at larger issuers, the news was even more encouraging.</p>\n<p>And for the first time, there are no all-male boards among the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index companies, and none of the S&amp;P/TSX 60 companies has fewer than two female directors.

Before becoming Co-Chair, Dale led the firm as our National Managing Partner and Chief Executive from 2009 to 2016. When she assumed the role, Dale was the only woman in the country to serve as chief executive of a major law firm and is still among the very few woman lawyers to have led a business law firm in Canada.</p>\n<p>Maureen Killoran, KC, succeeded Dale and joined Shahir Guindi as National Co-Chair, effective January 1, 2022. Maureen, who practises out of Osler&rsquo;s Calgary and Vancouver offices, was formerly Office Managing Partner in Calgary from 2011 to 2017 and was the first woman to be named Managing Partner of a Calgary law firm.</p>\n<p>A trusted advisor to clients in Western Canada, Maureen is regarded as one of the nation&rsquo;s top litigators. &ldquo;While we are extremely proud of what we have accomplished over the years, we recognize that continued growth and support is a perpetual requirement in our profession to shorten the gap in equality and increased diversity&rdquo;, says Maureen Killoran.</p>\n<p>Osler has five Office Managing Partners, two of whom are outstanding women &ndash; Sandra Abitan in Montr&eacute;al and Donna White in Ottawa.

It&rsquo;s about uplifting others and creating platforms for them so that their voices are heard, and they feel supported.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a corporate strategy, a box to check off on a list, or a marketing campaign focusing on one day, week, or month of the year.</p>\n<p>While yes, it&rsquo;s nice to see companies posting support for Pride, or International Women&rsquo;s Day, or sharing good wishes for Ramadan, unless you can demonstrate what you do for the rest of the year - REAL results and policy changes - it rings hollow.</p>\n<p>ACTIVE allyship is how you interact with and are intentional about including the people around you.</p>\n<p>Every. Day. 24/7.</p>\n<p><strong>Allies are emerging everywhere</strong></p>\n<p>With more and more people willing to speak up about their experiences and more and more people standing up in support as allies, conversations are changing.</p>\n<p>Allies make a huge impact on the success (or failure) of change. And as a leader, your allyship can be the most impactful of all!</p>\n<p>Here are 5 things to implement in your active allyship journey.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Demonstrate Empathy, Not Shock</strong></p>\n<p>Acknowledge the situation or event and make it about the person who experienced it. Saying, &ldquo;How awful, I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t actually supportive; it dismisses the other person&rsquo;s experience. Many of us will never know what it&rsquo;s like to have to put your driver&rsquo;s license and registration on the dashboard BEFORE a police officer approaches the car.</p>\n<p>Or worse, what it&rsquo;s like having to teach our racialized children to do this.</p>\n<p>Saying &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you have to do this!&rdquo; reinforces our privilege; we&rsquo;ve never had to do this action, so we find it incredible that others DO.</p>\n<p>Instead, offer: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful that happened to you. Please say more.&rdquo; Or sit in silence creating space for them to share more if they choose.</p>\n<p>Allies make the conversation about the other person and how they were affected. Practice being an active listener.</p>\n<p>Repeat what you heard them say and make sure you have captured their words and feelings correctly.</p>\n<p>Listen more than you speak. Show them you hear them and value the trust they placed in you by sharing their story.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Understand Your Biases.</strong></p>\n<p>\"If you have a brain, you have a bias.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Everyone has biases. It&rsquo;s a fact.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s important is to identify YOUR biases and see how they affect your thoughts and actions.</p>\n<p>In a Harvard Business Review article, Leadership Impact Coach Carmen Acton says, &ldquo;We typically develop unconscious biases as a result of the things we were taught and the observations we made throughout our childhood and adolescence &mdash; at home, at school, in conversations with friends, and through the media we consumed (and still do).&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Visualize a doctor. Most people will picture a man. Less now, than say 10 years ago, but still, a majority picture a man.</p>\n<p>Now visualize a nurse. Did you picture a man? Why or why not?</p>\n<p>Look at your assumptions in various situations. Consider how your perception of a particular culture or physical condition has been affected by stereotypes. Try to understand where your beliefs and ideas are coming from.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Be curious</strong></p>\n<p>Our minds are neuroplastic, and once stretched by a new idea, will never return to their original shape. We can make an impact on our own lives by choosing how we think, what matters to us, and what will define and represent who we are in the world.</p>\n<p>In choosing how we think, though, we need to qualify and check our assumptions and understandings. Even our Google search results will be affected by our biases and any previous search we may have made. (Possibly even the things our smartphones have heard us say. Frightening to think of, I know!)</p>\n<p>Interesting fact:</p>\n<p>my Google search will not give the same results as your Google search. We&rsquo;ll get different sites and references for our questions shaped by the algorithm of our previous searches.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s up to YOU to educate yourself about the situation by doing your research - and making sure it&rsquo;s from a valid source!</p>\n<p>By demonstrating your curiosity about the situation and making an effort to learn more, you become a stronger and more informed ally.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll find your outlook changes and your experience of the world will be better for it!</p>\n<p><strong>4. Use your voice to amplify</strong></p>\n<p>You may have heard this story before; in the Obama White House during his first term in office, women staff members, tired of being overlooked in meetings, started a practice they called &ldquo;amplification&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>When a woman made a point in the meeting, other women in the room would amplify it, by repeating the point and identifying the original speaker: &ldquo;As Naomi said, this would be an excellent way to do X&rdquo; or &ldquo;I agree with Amira! She was right about Y.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The example here involves women, but the same principle applies to make sure that people with different cultural backgrounds and experiences are heard.</p>\n<p>Their perspective can spark the idea that transforms your product or service into something even more remarkable. That&rsquo;s a win for everyone.</p>\n<p>As executives and leaders, you have the unique privilege of being able to amplify the voices around you. Find ways to implement and encourage DEI education and awareness in your workplace and policies that help balance personal and work lives.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Call out discrimination and microaggressions</strong></p>\n<p>Discrimination in all forms is wrong. We&rsquo;re all in agreement here.</p>\n<p>I believe that most microaggressions come from a place of ignorance and require education instead of retaliation or cancellation. They can range from using idiomatic expressions with racist undertones to making comments about age, gender, ethnicity, ability, or other characteristics.</p>\n<p>A lot of our common expressions have their roots in racism. For example, saying &ldquo;Long time no see&rdquo; or &ldquo;No can do&rdquo; is a microaggression towards non-English speakers. Most times, it&rsquo;s safer just to say the words and drop the expression: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been ages since I saw you!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Even calling someone or something &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; can be a microaggression and deeply upsetting to someone experiencing mental health issues themselves or someone close to them.</p>\n<p>Other microaggressions come when talking about a physical appearance or ability.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, it comes down to common sense. You don&rsquo;t need to be a member of a BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, or People of Colour) community to identify someone being impacted by a racist encounter. You don&rsquo;t need to be 2SLGBTQI+ to hear an inappropriate comment and call the speaker out.</p>\n<p>For a junior member of your team, it can take a lot of courage to speak up.</p>\n<p>Encourage your staff to call out microaggressions in respectful and thoughtful ways. Demonstrate this in your meetings and interactions and watch your team thrive and grow.</p>\n<p><strong>So what now?</strong></p>\n<p>If you feel shocked by anything you just read, just imagine how your colleague, friend, or customer must feel experiencing them every day.</p>\n<p>But there is good news!</p>\n<p>The fact that you&rsquo;ve read this far means that you are already on your way to becoming a better ally, a better friend, and a better colleague.</p>\n<p>You want to be able to live &ldquo;sawubona&rdquo; and for people around you to experience it.</p>\n<p>Thank you for continuing the work towards active allyship.</p>\n<p>And to your &ldquo;sawubona&rdquo;, I reply with &ldquo;shiboka&rdquo; - &ldquo;I exist for you&rdquo;.</p>",

Many of us will never know what it&rsquo;s like to have to put your driver&rsquo;s license and registration on the dashboard BEFORE a police officer approaches the car.</p>\n<p>Or worse, what it&rsquo;s like having to teach our racialized children to do this.</p>\n<p>Saying &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you have to do this!&rdquo; reinforces our privilege; we&rsquo;ve never had to do this action, so we find it incredible that others DO.</p>\n<p>Instead, offer: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful that happened to you. Please say more.&rdquo; Or sit in silence creating space for them to share more if they choose.</p>\n<p>Allies make the conversation about the other person and how they were affected. Practice being an active listener.</p>\n<p>Repeat what you heard them say and make sure you have captured their words and feelings correctly.</p>\n<p>Listen more than you speak. Show them you hear them and value the trust they placed in you by sharing their story.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Understand Your Biases.</strong></p>\n<p>\"If you have a brain, you have a bias.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Everyone has biases. It&rsquo;s a fact.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s important is to identify YOUR biases and see how they affect your thoughts and actions.</p>\n<p>In a Harvard Business Review article, Leadership Impact Coach Carmen Acton says, &ldquo;We typically develop unconscious biases as a result of the things we were taught and the observations we made throughout our childhood and adolescence &mdash; at home, at school, in conversations with friends, and through the media we consumed (and still do).&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Visualize a doctor. Most people will picture a man. Less now, than say 10 years ago, but still, a majority picture a man.</p>\n<p>Now visualize a nurse. Did you picture a man? Why or why not?</p>\n<p>Look at your assumptions in various situations. Consider how your perception of a particular culture or physical condition has been affected by stereotypes. Try to understand where your beliefs and ideas are coming from.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Be curious</strong></p>\n<p>Our minds are neuroplastic, and once stretched by a new idea, will never return to their original shape. We can make an impact on our own lives by choosing how we think, what matters to us, and what will define and represent who we are in the world.</p>\n<p>In choosing how we think, though, we need to qualify and check our assumptions and understandings. Even our Google search results will be affected by our biases and any previous search we may have made. (Possibly even the things our smartphones have heard us say. Frightening to think of, I know!)</p>\n<p>Interesting fact:</p>\n<p>my Google search will not give the same results as your Google search. We&rsquo;ll get different sites and references for our questions shaped by the algorithm of our previous searches.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s up to YOU to educate yourself about the situation by doing your research - and making sure it&rsquo;s from a valid source!</p>\n<p>By demonstrating your curiosity about the situation and making an effort to learn more, you become a stronger and more informed ally.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll find your outlook changes and your experience of the world will be better for it!</p>\n<p><strong>4. Use your voice to amplify</strong></p>\n<p>You may have heard this story before; in the Obama White House during his first term in office, women staff members, tired of being overlooked in meetings, started a practice they called &ldquo;amplification&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>When a woman made a point in the meeting, other women in the room would amplify it, by repeating the point and identifying the original speaker: &ldquo;As Naomi said, this would be an excellent way to do X&rdquo; or &ldquo;I agree with Amira! She was right about Y.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The example here involves women, but the same principle applies to make sure that people with different cultural backgrounds and experiences are heard.</p>\n<p>Their perspective can spark the idea that transforms your product or service into something even more remarkable. That&rsquo;s a win for everyone.</p>\n<p>As executives and leaders, you have the unique privilege of being able to amplify the voices around you. Find ways to implement and encourage DEI education and awareness in your workplace and policies that help balance personal and work lives.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Call out discrimination and microaggressions</strong></p>\n<p>Discrimination in all forms is wrong. We&rsquo;re all in agreement here.</p>\n<p>I believe that most microaggressions come from a place of ignorance and require education instead of retaliation or cancellation. They can range from using idiomatic expressions with racist undertones to making comments about age, gender, ethnicity, ability, or other characteristics.</p>\n<p>A lot of our common expressions have their roots in racism. For example, saying &ldquo;Long time no see&rdquo; or &ldquo;No can do&rdquo; is a microaggression towards non-English speakers. Most times, it&rsquo;s safer just to say the words and drop the expression: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been ages since I saw you!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Even calling someone or something &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; can be a microaggression and deeply upsetting to someone experiencing mental health issues themselves or someone close to them.</p>\n<p>Other microaggressions come when talking about a physical appearance or ability.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, it comes down to common sense. You don&rsquo;t need to be a member of a BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, or People of Colour) community to identify someone being impacted by a racist encounter. You don&rsquo;t need to be 2SLGBTQI+ to hear an inappropriate comment and call the speaker out.</p>\n<p>For a junior member of your team, it can take a lot of courage to speak up.</p>\n<p>Encourage your staff to call out microaggressions in respectful and thoughtful ways. Demonstrate this in your meetings and interactions and watch your team thrive and grow.</p>\n<p><strong>So what now?</strong></p>\n<p>If you feel shocked by anything you just read, just imagine how your colleague, friend, or customer must feel experiencing them every day.</p>\n<p>But there is good news!</p>\n<p>The fact that you&rsquo;ve read this far means that you are already on your way to becoming a better ally, a better friend, and a better colleague.</p>\n<p>You want to be able to live &ldquo;sawubona&rdquo; and for people around you to experience it.</p>\n<p>Thank you for continuing the work towards active allyship.</p>\n<p>And to your &ldquo;sawubona&rdquo;, I reply with &ldquo;shiboka&rdquo; - &ldquo;I exist for you&rdquo;.</p>"

      "description": "<p>The most common theme in the return-to-office debate is whether remote work is productive.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m worried about how we&rsquo;re managing the return-to-office transition. We&rsquo;re pretending the issue is productivity while actually fighting over control. And with our attention on those debates, we&rsquo;re missing the damage being done to our work communities. We need a reset.</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s Not About Productivity</strong></p>\n<p>On one side, happy remote workers argue that they&rsquo;re more productive because they don&rsquo;t spend time on primping, commuting, or escaping from Andrea, the office gossip, after ill-timed trips to the coffee machine. On the other side, managers aren&rsquo;t buying it. In a recent Microsoft study, 85% of managers report being &ldquo;paranoid&rdquo; that their remote employees aren&rsquo;t effective.</p>\n<p>This is, as they say, an empirical question. Fortunately, we now have evidence that, for the most part, productivity is slightly higher for remote or hybrid employees, primarily because they work longer hours. So, we&rsquo;re arguing about productivity when data suggests that remote productivity isn&rsquo;t a problem. So, leaders, let&rsquo;s move on, shall we?</p>\n<p><strong>The Current Fight is About Control</strong></p>\n<p>What we&rsquo;re really fighting over is control. Managers want to wrest their power back. They&rsquo;re clashing with employees relishing their newfound control and determined not to revert to how it was.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that leaders want to observe people in their chairs. Most have no other way of gauging productivity because they&rsquo;ve never figured out what performing looks like. They&rsquo;ve never defined outcomes. Instead, they contented themselves that people were &ldquo;busy&rdquo; or &ldquo;working hard&rdquo; by gauging how fast they typed, how frantically they ran between meetings, and how stressed they looked. Now they can&rsquo;t see any of that; they&rsquo;re left with a sinking feeling of being cheated.</p>\n<p>They face motivated adversaries&mdash;employees who want to maintain control of how they integrate work and personal responsibilities, control over whom they have to look at, talk to, and smell, control of the thermostat, coffee strength, and the number of plies in the toilet paper. I get it. If you&rsquo;re an employee who&rsquo;s created an environment ideally suited to you, why would you want to give that up?</p>\n<p>Dig one level deeper, and the concerns become even more legitimate. For example, remote work means that when you have a sick parent or child, it no longer necessitates a vacation day for a one-hour doctor&rsquo;s appointment. If you have ADHD, you finally have a set-up that helps you be successful. If you&rsquo;re a visible minority, you endure fewer micro-aggressions.</p>\n<p>Leaders, we need more empathy around the magnitude of the sacrifice we&rsquo;re asking people to make. I&rsquo;m not saying employees shouldn&rsquo;t be back a few days a week; I&rsquo;m asking you to acknowledge how big of a request that is for some people.</p>\n<p><strong>Community is Worth Fighting For</strong></p>\n<p>Once you empathize with the toll office work takes, you can make a case for why it&rsquo;s worth it. And the reason is all about community.</p>\n<p>In honing their remote work routines, employees have created tighter and tighter cocoons around themselves. Managers have allowed it. They&rsquo;ve worked so hard on creating SMART goals and driving individual accountability that they&rsquo;ve forgotten to articulate their expectations for what it means to be a good team player or upstanding organizational citizen. If we measure people&rsquo;s performance based on how many lines of code they write or how many reports they produce, we have no leg to stand on in encouraging them back to the office. They will write more code if we leave them be.</p>\n<p>Only once we define people&rsquo;s roles as contributors to healthy, productive teams with clearly articulated expectations for responsibilities beyond their individual tasks (such as supporting people who are developing, contributing to others&rsquo; ideas, and identifying risks and assumptions in plans) will we be able to justify returning to the office. Managers need your direction and your help on that.</p>\n<p><strong>Tame the Meeting Monster</strong></p>\n<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, leaders need to make one more critical change if we expect employees back in the office three or more days per week. We need to take ownership of the mess that is our current work week. According to research by Microsoft, employees are sitting through 250% more hours in meetings now than before the pandemic, averaging 21 hours per week. If we add the average email burden of 12 hours, that&rsquo;s 33 hours, leaving only 7 hours to think, read, research, coach, ponder, reflect, write, analyze, prepare, and pee.</p>\n<p>Those who work remotely then reinvest 40% of those savings into work. That adds up to half an hour more every day for your employees to respond to emails or do tasks that didn&rsquo;t get done during the workday because they were in meetings from dawn to dusk.</p>\n<p>As a leader, where does the overflow go if you stick with the current meeting and email burden and now require employees to return to the office? The only place to get individual work done is earlier in the morning (before the commute), later in the evening (after the commute), or on the weekend.</p>\n<p>For many knowledge workers, asking them to return to the office is asking them to divert more and more personal time to work. That&rsquo;s a bad deal. I don&rsquo;t blame them for rejecting it.</p>\n<p>Workload has become unmanageable. Many employees are keeping their heads above water by repurposing the time they used to spend commuting to squeeze in some of the work that was squeezed out by a steep increase in meetings. If you want people back in the office more often, you must address the meeting bloat and the email monster.</p>\n<p><strong>This fight is about more than our empty offices; this fight is about the future of work.</strong></p>\n<p>You have an opportunity to reset in a way that&rsquo;s better for business and better for humans. Stop talking about productivity; start talking about community. Define what&rsquo;s non-negotiable and throw everything else open. Deal with the bloat in your meetings and email.</p>\n<p>Lead the way.</p>",

I&rsquo;m not saying employees shouldn&rsquo;t be back a few days a week; I&rsquo;m asking you to acknowledge how big of a request that is for some people.</p>\n<p><strong>Community is Worth Fighting For</strong></p>\n<p>Once you empathize with the toll office work takes, you can make a case for why it&rsquo;s worth it. And the reason is all about community.</p>\n<p>In honing their remote work routines, employees have created tighter and tighter cocoons around themselves. Managers have allowed it. They&rsquo;ve worked so hard on creating SMART goals and driving individual accountability that they&rsquo;ve forgotten to articulate their expectations for what it means to be a good team player or upstanding organizational citizen. If we measure people&rsquo;s performance based on how many lines of code they write or how many reports they produce, we have no leg to stand on in encouraging them back to the office. They will write more code if we leave them be.</p>\n<p>Only once we define people&rsquo;s roles as contributors to healthy, productive teams with clearly articulated expectations for responsibilities beyond their individual tasks (such as supporting people who are developing, contributing to others&rsquo; ideas, and identifying risks and assumptions in plans) will we be able to justify returning to the office. Managers need your direction and your help on that.</p>\n<p><strong>Tame the Meeting Monster</strong></p>\n<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, leaders need to make one more critical change if we expect employees back in the office three or more days per week. We need to take ownership of the mess that is our current work week. According to research by Microsoft, employees are sitting through 250% more hours in meetings now than before the pandemic, averaging 21 hours per week. If we add the average email burden of 12 hours, that&rsquo;s 33 hours, leaving only 7 hours to think, read, research, coach, ponder, reflect, write, analyze, prepare, and pee.</p>\n<p>Those who work remotely then reinvest 40% of those savings into work. That adds up to half an hour more every day for your employees to respond to emails or do tasks that didn&rsquo;t get done during the workday because they were in meetings from dawn to dusk.</p>\n<p>As a leader, where does the overflow go if you stick with the current meeting and email burden and now require employees to return to the office? The only place to get individual work done is earlier in the morning (before the commute), later in the evening (after the commute), or on the weekend.</p>\n<p>For many knowledge workers, asking them to return to the office is asking them to divert more and more personal time to work. That&rsquo;s a bad deal. I don&rsquo;t blame them for rejecting it.</p>\n<p>Workload has become unmanageable. Many employees are keeping their heads above water by repurposing the time they used to spend commuting to squeeze in some of the work that was squeezed out by a steep increase in meetings. If you want people back in the office more often, you must address the meeting bloat and the email monster.</p>\n<p><strong>This fight is about more than our empty offices; this fight is about the future of work.</strong></p>\n<p>You have an opportunity to reset in a way that&rsquo;s better for business and better for humans. Stop talking about productivity; start talking about community. Define what&rsquo;s non-negotiable and throw everything else open. Deal with the bloat in your meetings and email.</p>\n<p>Lead the way.</p>"

      "description": "<p>I think Yogi Berra was talking about leadership when he spoke of the difference between theory and practice. &ldquo;In theory&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;theory and practice are the same but in practice they are different&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s because in practice you add people. Adding people makes it anything but simple.</p>\n<p>Leadership is similar. In theory, it&rsquo;s simple: focus people with a vision, strategy and plan, and then inspire them, as individuals and teams, to implement that vision and change the world. It&rsquo;s simple until you add people. Adding people, like with theory, makes it anything but simple. A minority will be with you automatically. A few will be way out in front and wondering why you&rsquo;re so slow getting to where they already are. Some don&rsquo;t want to be inspired, others are incapable of working as part of a team, more see themselves as here temporarily, elsewhere soon. Initially, many will not have assimilated a vision as theirs. A few always will be parasites on the good work of others. Some, hopefully very few, just don&rsquo;t belong. Its complicated. Often tough.</p>\n<p><strong>Leadership is all about people.</strong></p>\n<p>We in the Canadian Forces realized that Canada&rsquo;s sons and daughters were key to success. Our best weapons didn&rsquo;t roll on wheels or rumble on tracks &ndash; they walked in combat boots. Leadership is about people. Use your energies, abilities, education, training, common sense, tools of the trade and anything else you can to win them over and you&rsquo;ll be ok as a leader. That is step one - win the hearts and minds of those who you want to follow you. I learned that lesson very early in life. Mentored by a non-commissioned officer, one of our unsung, great leaders, with so much more experience than me, I got it. He said, &ldquo;sir, you get my body because you pay for it, my mind you get for free. However, if you want me to bring my mind to work with my body, you&rsquo;ve got to fill me with piss and vinegar so that when I get up in the morning, I want to come to soldier with you and change the world.&rdquo;. I never forgot it. Win this first and most important battle. Job #1.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a team that people want to join.</strong></p>\n<p>Make it a team that they&rsquo;ll even fight to join. When they&rsquo;re applying, make sure you meet with them, be identified as the leader who takes an interest, and if there&rsquo;s a delay between their application and onboarding, reach out to them, more than once if necessary, and let them know what&rsquo;s happening; that they&rsquo;re not forgotten and what will come next. Use this to start becoming their leader of choice. They must see you as a real person, an individual who is interested in them, getting to know them and is welcoming them to the team. This is leader business, not the work of staffers. Build a relationship early. When they do join the team, welcome and introduce them. Bring them into the fold. They&rsquo;ll be uncertain, nervous and perhaps even downright scared, so give them that warm welcome, confidence that it&rsquo;s going to be great and they&rsquo;ve found their niche. Onboard well.</p>\n<p>Make sure they&rsquo;re trained and equipped to do the job you&rsquo;re asking them to do. Get it right. Training is crucial and includes an educational component &ndash; what is that vision, what does it mean, how does the strategy lead into the plan and what are the team&rsquo;s priorities? That is how most of us understand how to put our shoulder behind the crucial things that need to get done on an hourly basis. That&rsquo;s part of the curriculum. Equipping them with what&rsquo;s necessary to be successful is essential to confidence, initiative and independent action. Your actions as a leader in this will speak loudly. Whether it&rsquo;s a cell phone, a laptop or a fighter jet, make sure they&rsquo;ve got what&rsquo;s needed. Train and equip.</p>\n<p>Get to know their circumstances, personalities, strengths and weaknesses. Make sure you know their family situation to the extent possible, so that if necessary, you can help if help is needed. Families have a powerful vote over how a man or woman performs at work and whether they stay with a team or not. Simple compassionate caring, a modicum of support and an interest goes a long way to make that family feel valued, supportive and willing to stay for the long haul, even if there are tough times. Remember the families.</p>\n<p><strong>Communications are critical, perhaps your centre of gravity as a leader.</strong></p>\n<p>If you want people to continue to follow you they have to believe that they&rsquo;re valued, important, key to achieving things, recognized and influential. Yes, you use words, briefings, social media, newsletters, promotional materials and more to achieve this, but most important of all are your actions!

          "textOnly": "<p>I think Yogi Berra was talking about leadership when he spoke of the difference between theory and practice. &ldquo;In theory&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;theory and practice are the same but in practice they are different&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s because in practice you add people. Adding people makes it anything but simple.</p>\n<p>Leadership is similar. In theory, it&rsquo;s simple: focus people with a vision, strategy and plan, and then inspire them, as individuals and teams, to implement that vision and change the world. It&rsquo;s simple until you add people. Adding people, like with theory, makes it anything but simple. A minority will be with you automatically. A few will be way out in front and wondering why you&rsquo;re so slow getting to where they already are. Some don&rsquo;t want to be inspired, others are incapable of working as part of a team, more see themselves as here temporarily, elsewhere soon. Initially, many will not have assimilated a vision as theirs. A few always will be parasites on the good work of others. Some, hopefully very few, just don&rsquo;t belong. Its complicated. Often tough.</p>\n<p><strong>Leadership is all about people.</strong></p>\n<p>We in the Canadian Forces realized that Canada&rsquo;s sons and daughters were key to success. Our best weapons didn&rsquo;t roll on wheels or rumble on tracks &ndash; they walked in combat boots. Leadership is about people. Use your energies, abilities, education, training, common sense, tools of the trade and anything else you can to win them over and you&rsquo;ll be ok as a leader. That is step one - win the hearts and minds of those who you want to follow you. I learned that lesson very early in life. Mentored by a non-commissioned officer, one of our unsung, great leaders, with so much more experience than me, I got it. He said, &ldquo;sir, you get my body because you pay for it, my mind you get for free. However, if you want me to bring my mind to work with my body, you&rsquo;ve got to fill me with piss and vinegar so that when I get up in the morning, I want to come to soldier with you and change the world.&rdquo;. I never forgot it. Win this first and most important battle. Job #1.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a team that people want to join.</strong></p>\n<p>Make it a team that they&rsquo;ll even fight to join. When they&rsquo;re applying, make sure you meet with them, be identified as the leader who takes an interest, and if there&rsquo;s a delay between their application and onboarding, reach out to them, more than once if necessary, and let them know what&rsquo;s happening; that they&rsquo;re not forgotten and what will come next. Use this to start becoming their leader of choice. They must see you as a real person, an individual who is interested in them, getting to know them and is welcoming them to the team. This is leader business, not the work of staffers. Build a relationship early. When they do join the team, welcome and introduce them. Bring them into the fold. They&rsquo;ll be uncertain, nervous and perhaps even downright scared, so give them that warm welcome, confidence that it&rsquo;s going to be great and they&rsquo;ve found their niche. Onboard well.</p>\n<p>Make sure they&rsquo;re trained and equipped to do the job you&rsquo;re asking them to do. Get it right. Training is crucial and includes an educational component &ndash; what is that vision, what does it mean, how does the strategy lead into the plan and what are the team&rsquo;s priorities? That is how most of us understand how to put our shoulder behind the crucial things that need to get done on an hourly basis. That&rsquo;s part of the curriculum. Equipping them with what&rsquo;s necessary to be successful is essential to confidence, initiative and independent action. Your actions as a leader in this will speak loudly. Whether it&rsquo;s a cell phone, a laptop or a fighter jet, make sure they&rsquo;ve got what&rsquo;s needed. Train and equip.</p>\n<p>Get to know their circumstances, personalities, strengths and weaknesses. Make sure you know their family situation to the extent possible, so that if necessary, you can help if help is needed. Families have a powerful vote over how a man or woman performs at work and whether they stay with a team or not. Simple compassionate caring, a modicum of support and an interest goes a long way to make that family feel valued, supportive and willing to stay for the long haul, even if there are tough times. Remember the families.</p>\n<p><strong>Communications are critical, perhaps your centre of gravity as a leader.</strong></p>\n<p>If you want people to continue to follow you they have to believe that they&rsquo;re valued, important, key to achieving things, recognized and influential. Yes, you use words, briefings, social media, newsletters, promotional materials and more to achieve this, but most important of all are your actions! How you talk, interact with people, treat individuals and what you deliver is telling. As a leader, you live in a fishbowl and your actions, however minor, will be seen and judged. If you talk one way, act another, promise but don&rsquo;t deliver, treat others arrogantly while talking about respect, you will fail. Synchronize your vision, plans, words, values and interpersonal skills so they are complementary. There is no such thing for example, as situational ethics.

There are parts of it that reflect legitimate grievances with the elite consensus. There are others that should be opposed. What is happening requires understanding and adaptation, not dogma and condescension.</p>\n<p><strong>Populists are not ignorant and misguided &ldquo;deplorables.&rdquo; They are our family, friends, and neighbours.</strong></p>\n<p>The populists are, by definition, the people.</p>\n<p>In a democratic system, the people are our customers. And, according to conservative market values, the customer is always right. Part of developing these alternatives involves challenging some preconceived ideas about populism. Populism is not entirely incompatible with markets, trade, globalization, and immigration. My own political career is proof.</p>\n<p>My time as prime minister occurred largely during and after the global financial crisis. Under my government, Canada avoided the worst of the crisis and came out of it all the stronger. For Canadian Conservatives, it was the longest-serving government since 1891. By any measure, we left the country in good shape. No populist insurgency arose on our right, and as a consequence, since we returned to opposition in 2015, we have remained a strong and united party.</p>\n<p>Through our numerous successes &mdash; and our occasional blunders &mdash; Canadian Conservatives were implementing many of the policies and strategies that are necessary to respond to the challenges that Western societies currently face. I call this approach &ldquo;populist conservatism.&rdquo; What is populist conservatism? It is about putting conservative values and ideas into the service of working people and their families. It is about using conservative means for populist ends.</p>\n<p>My populism was, I suppose, an outgrowth of a public-school, middle-class background. That experience taught me the importance of making policy relevant to regular working families. Donald Trump&rsquo;s upset victory and tumultuous first eighteen months in office have produced plenty of predictions about our future politics. Some claim conservatism is &ldquo;dead.&rdquo; Others say the same about populism. But none of this changes the forces that put Trump in office. Populism will be with us as long as working men, women, and families continue to face current economic and social pressures, and conventional political parties do not adapt. And if they do not, troubling elements of the populist agenda could prove more potent in the hands of more focused political operators.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy-making does not occur within a textbook version of reality.</strong></p>\n<p>It happens in the real world, with trade-offs, imperfect options, and non-economic considerations. There are a lot of obituaries being written, citing the decline of the West in general and of America in particular. These contain some elements of truth. For many of their authors, however, such a decline would clearly be a welcome development.</p>\n<p>I do not share this perspective. There is no question that the Western world &mdash; most notably the United States &mdash; is going through a period of tumult and disruption. Nonetheless, democratic capitalist societies have historically shown unparalleled dynamism, resiliency, and adaptability.</p>\n<p><strong>I am confident that, with the right ideas, right choices, and right leadership, we will come out of this era better and stronger.</strong></p>\n<p>There are many people who seem to believe that they can wish the events of 2016 away. Influential elements in the United Kingdom &mdash; those sarcastically labelled &ldquo;Remoaners&rdquo; &mdash; look to reverse the Brexit vote or, at a minimum, to get a deal with the European Union that apes the U.K.&rsquo;s current relationship. In the United States, much of the anti-Trump narrative displays a desire to deny the simple reality that he won because enough people in enough places willingly voted for him. The underlying hope in both cases is that things will &ldquo;go back&rdquo; to the way they were.</p>\n<p>But that is not the trend. Populist, nationalist, and anti-establishment movements are continuing to grow. Just look at Europe. A late 2017 analysis of 22 European countries revealed that support for such parties is at its highest level in at least three decades. Recent votes in the Netherlands, the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere have seen such options make significant gains at the expense of the traditional centre left and centre right. In some cases, they are close to taking power. Even where they are not, they are often rendering the formation of government coalitions lengthy and laborious.</p>\n<p><strong>My diagnosis is simple: the populist trend will not stop until the issues driving it are being effectively addressed.</strong></p>\n<p>True, these new populist alternatives may ultimately fall short in the eyes of many of their followers. But human nature teaches us that those so disappointed are unlikely to &ldquo;go back.&rdquo; For the reasons they left in the first place, they will move on to the next new thing.</p>\n<p>The more I have looked at these big political surprises, the less I think they should have been surprises.</p>\n<p><strong>We are living in an age of disruption of unprecedented scale, scope, and pace.</strong></p>\n<p>Whole industries are coming and going. New technologies are remaking jobs and communities. Cultural norms are shifting almost randomly. Seemingly no institution or aspect of traditional life is immune.</p>\n<p>It is understandable &mdash; even predictable &mdash; that ordinary working people would be anxious under such circumstances. On top of that, the data indicates that significant numbers of them are experiencing serious, negative consequences. Thus, broad social disruption is morphing into widespread political disruption as night follows day. And this trend will continue if traditional political options, both conservative and liberal, double down on existing approaches.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we must build an agenda that, while based on our enduring values, is focused on the issues that working people and their families are facing today. It must especially address populist concerns about market economics, trade, globalization, and immigration.</p>\n<p>In addressing these things, conservatives should remain pro-market, pro-trade, pro-globalization, and pro-immigration at heart. Going in a completely opposite direction in any of these areas would be a big mistake with serious ramifications. But being pro-market does not mean that all regulations should be dismantled or that governments should never intervene. Being pro-trade does not imply that any commercial arrangement is a good one. Being pro-globalization should not entail abdicating loyalty or responsibility to our countries. And being pro-immigration should never mean sanctioning the erasure of our borders or ignoring the interests of our citizens.</p>\n<p>In short, being pro-something is not an excuse for ideological tangents. It is about getting back to pragmatic applications of our values and away from theoretical abstraction in our actions. When it comes to public policy, it is about rolling up our sleeves, knowing the details, and monitoring the impacts on people&rsquo;s lives. Yes, we have a general orientation, but that does not render all choices obvious or easy.</p>\n<p>One can call this &ldquo;populist conservatism&rdquo; or &ldquo;applied conservatism,&rdquo; but, to my mind, it is really just conservatism. Conservatism is about seeing the world as it is and applying the lessons of experience to new challenges.</p>\n<p>It is inherently populist in the sense that it is necessarily concerned with people rather than theories.</p>\n<p>Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer once wrote that &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t get politics right, everything else risks extinction.&rdquo; It seems a tad hyperbolic, but bad human relations do have a way of wrecking everything else. Stable and responsive politics is an essential ingredient to a strong, dynamic society. Places where politics fail invariably experience broader economic and social challenges.</p>\n<p>Politics is not everything, but it is essential in providing a framework for individuals, families, and communities to succeed. Politics today is exceptionally troubled. That is a great irony. This is an exciting time to be alive. We are in an age of greater wealth for more people than ever before. We are living longer and healthier lives. Technological developments are opening doors to human possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>But to seize these opportunities, we need to ensure that we get our politics right.</strong></p>\n<p>Whether or not you accept my analysis and prescriptions, I hope they will cause you to think about what we can do in this unprecedented age of disruption to get it right &mdash; right here, right now.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><em>Excerpted from Right Here, Right Now: Politics and Leadership in the Age of Disruption by Stephen J.

This is an important step. Now, I want to ask a slightly more challenging question. What is person, team, or policy&rsquo;s explicit aim? How precisely has the vision or strategy been defined, and how clearly has the organization articulated the &lsquo;why&rsquo;?</p>\n<p>Over many years, I have seen, been subject to, and studied how &lsquo;diversity&rsquo;, &lsquo;inclusion&rsquo;, &lsquo;equity&rsquo; and &lsquo;belonging&rsquo; have evolved in the corporate world. These terms have been around for almost 50 years in the UK, after the passing of the Equal Pay Act in 1970 began bringing social change to workplaces. However, their meanings and uses have shifted over time. In the push for progress, these terms and movements have occasionally become co-opted and repurposed by those who are not genuinely interested in changing the status quo.

      "description": "<p>Looking back on the past three years, three things have become abundantly clear: The world around us is moving faster than it ever has before, the labour force is tighter than it has been in the past 50 years, and that the future is wildly impossible to predict.</p>\n<p>I mean, did anyone really think that Britain would have 3 prime ministers in 6 weeks? That Tiger King would be the number one show on Netflix? That gas prices would be nearly as volatile as cryptocurrency. Our collective crystal ball is broken and the conversation we really need to be having about the future of work is not one that hypothesizes what is it going to look like but rather how it is we are going to get there &ndash; wherever it may be.</p>\n<p>Coined by Buckminster Fuller all the way back in 1958 as The Knowledge Doubling Curve and now backed by IBM, it was discovered that due to the rapid increase of communication and technology, the amount of information we have access to is doubling at an alarming rate. Before 1900, the amount of information we had access to doubled every one hundred years. Since then, it has been doubling at a halved rate. From 1900 to 1950, the amount of information we had access to doubled. From 1950-1975, it doubled again. And from 1975-1988, you guessed it, another doubling. Now, because of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the amount of information we have access to is doubling every few hours &ndash; incredible! This means the world will continue to move faster, new &lsquo;best&rsquo; practices are being created faster, and change and uncertainty will truly be the only constants moving forward.</p>\n<p>And to make matters more dire, the unemployment rate in Canada (roughly 5%) is at near historic lows. We aren&rsquo;t reproducing enough to replace the working population, we can&rsquo;t welcome new Canadians into our country fast enough, retiring cohorts are leaving the workforce at twice the rate they were a decade ago, and technology as we know it has anyone selling Alibaba products with their own logo right from their basement.</p>\n<p>While these conversations could be important, finding out that the tech company from down the street has gone fully remote doesn&rsquo;t really help big creative agencies decide where they should be working from at all, does it? Instead of finding the latest, greatest study about hybrid work, we need to be shifting our focus from what others are doing, to taking a deep look in the mirror and asking ourselves &lsquo;what is best for us? And how do we build a team that is rooted in trust, resilient, and agile?&rsquo; The foundation of any great team that is successfully navigating &lsquo;next&rsquo; together is a deep sense of trust.</p>\n<p>These groups of people understand that the fastest way to speed up human connection is indeed to slow down. They know that those that build deeper connections with each other outside of typical work conversations will work better together when uncertainty presents itself and the proverbial going gets tough.</p>\n<p>Take it from the bottom-of-the-division 2020 Cleveland Browns. Coached by Kevin Stefanski (at the time, a rookie head coach) during the first wave of the pandemic, Stefanski knew that he had to bring his people together off the field so they could play better together on the field. His secret? The 4H drill. Kevin shared his Heroes, Heartbreak, Hopes, and History with the team. Following his vulnerability, willingness to share, and desire for the team to know him better, he asked if others would share too. Not long after, they had to schedule responses because team members were so eager to share, to feel, and to relate. This refreshing and effective exercise had the team connecting in ways they simply never had before. That year, the team went 11-5, went to the playoffs for the first time in 17 years, and won a playoff game for the first time in 28 years. Kevin&rsquo;s secret: he knew that when the team trusted each other off the field, they played better together on the field.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard it before &ndash; the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. What if the grass was greenest where it was watered? As we navigate the future of work together, it is imperative that we understand that trying to predict what the future of work is going to look like is a lot like trying to predict when the Toronto Maple Leafs will win the cup next. Sounds like an easy way for everyone to get disappointed.</p>\n<p>Whether we like it or not, we&rsquo;re all Trailblazers navigating our way through a future that has yet to be created. While many of us understand that it may be faster to go alone, if we want to go far, we must go together. To be able to truly thrive in the future of work we can&rsquo;t be stuck on what others are doing when it comes to where they work, how they work, and what it is they get done. Instead, the focus needs to shift internally. We must be asking our teams how they get their best work done, what it is that really makes them tick, and how we can continue to build deeper trust, deeper relationships, and a resilient team that can navigate whatever uncertainty the future of work will promises to bring.</p>",

          "textOnly": "<p>Looking back on the past three years, three things have become abundantly clear: The world around us is moving faster than it ever has before, the labour force is tighter than it has been in the past 50 years, and that the future is wildly impossible to predict.</p>\n<p>I mean, did anyone really think that Britain would have 3 prime ministers in 6 weeks? That Tiger King would be the number one show on Netflix? That gas prices would be nearly as volatile as cryptocurrency. Our collective crystal ball is broken and the conversation we really need to be having about the future of work is not one that hypothesizes what is it going to look like but rather how it is we are going to get there &ndash; wherever it may be.</p>\n<p>Coined by Buckminster Fuller all the way back in 1958 as The Knowledge Doubling Curve and now backed by IBM, it was discovered that due to the rapid increase of communication and technology, the amount of information we have access to is doubling at an alarming rate. Before 1900, the amount of information we had access to doubled every one hundred years. Since then, it has been doubling at a halved rate. From 1900 to 1950, the amount of information we had access to doubled. From 1950-1975, it doubled again. And from 1975-1988, you guessed it, another doubling. Now, because of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the amount of information we have access to is doubling every few hours &ndash; incredible! This means the world will continue to move faster, new &lsquo;best&rsquo; practices are being created faster, and change and uncertainty will truly be the only constants moving forward.</p>\n<p>And to make matters more dire, the unemployment rate in Canada (roughly 5%) is at near historic lows. We aren&rsquo;t reproducing enough to replace the working population, we can&rsquo;t welcome new Canadians into our country fast enough, retiring cohorts are leaving the workforce at twice the rate they were a decade ago, and technology as we know it has anyone selling Alibaba products with their own logo right from their basement.</p>\n<p>While these conversations could be important, finding out that the tech company from down the street has gone fully remote doesn&rsquo;t really help big creative agencies decide where they should be working from at all, does it? Instead of finding the latest, greatest study about hybrid work, we need to be shifting our focus from what others are doing, to taking a deep look in the mirror and asking ourselves &lsquo;what is best for us? And how do we build a team that is rooted in trust, resilient, and agile?&rsquo; The foundation of any great team that is successfully navigating &lsquo;next&rsquo; together is a deep sense of trust.</p>\n<p>These groups of people understand that the fastest way to speed up human connection is indeed to slow down. They know that those that build deeper connections with each other outside of typical work conversations will work better together when uncertainty presents itself and the proverbial going gets tough.</p>\n<p>Take it from the bottom-of-the-division 2020 Cleveland Browns. Coached by Kevin Stefanski (at the time, a rookie head coach) during the first wave of the pandemic, Stefanski knew that he had to bring his people together off the field so they could play better together on the field. His secret? The 4H drill. Kevin shared his Heroes, Heartbreak, Hopes, and History with the team. Following his vulnerability, willingness to share, and desire for the team to know him better, he asked if others would share too. Not long after, they had to schedule responses because team members were so eager to share, to feel, and to relate. This refreshing and effective exercise had the team connecting in ways they simply never had before. That year, the team went 11-5, went to the playoffs for the first time in 17 years, and won a playoff game for the first time in 28 years. Kevin&rsquo;s secret: he knew that when the team trusted each other off the field, they played better together on the field.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard it before &ndash; the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. What if the grass was greenest where it was watered? As we navigate the future of work together, it is imperative that we understand that trying to predict what the future of work is going to look like is a lot like trying to predict when the Toronto Maple Leafs will win the cup next. Sounds like an easy way for everyone to get disappointed.</p>\n<p>Whether we like it or not, we&rsquo;re all Trailblazers navigating our way through a future that has yet to be created. While many of us understand that it may be faster to go alone, if we want to go far, we must go together. To be able to truly thrive in the future of work we can&rsquo;t be stuck on what others are doing when it comes to where they work, how they work, and what it is they get done. Instead, the focus needs to shift internally. We must be asking our teams how they get their best work done, what it is that really makes them tick, and how we can continue to build deeper trust, deeper relationships, and a resilient team that can navigate whatever uncertainty the future of work will promises to bring.</p>"

Manipulations are simple and effective short term, but they are expensive to maintain and unstable long-term. Inspiration takes more discipline, but the long-term impact is astounding. The ability to inspire distinguishes good leaders from great ones. Examples of manipulations include dropping your price or having a promotion to overcome perceived risk or objections to close the sale. In marketing, fear is a wonderful manipulator, as is peer pressure. When a company tells us that they serve 70 percent of the market as a reason to do business, they are using peer pressure to close the deal. Aspirational messages, though positive, are also manipulations. You can convince someone to go once to the gym with an aspirational message, for example, but to get them to go three days a week requires inspiration. Manipulations work - that is why they&rsquo;re so pervasive. But they&rsquo;re costly to maintain, their gains short-term, and they don&rsquo;t breed loyalty.

Some know &lsquo;how&rsquo; they do it, whether you call it your differentiating value proposition or your proprietary process or USP. But few leaders or organizations can clearly state &lsquo;why&rsquo; they do what they do. This has nothing to do with money or profit - those are results. By why, I mean what&rsquo;s your purpose, cause or belief? Why does your company exist? Why did you get out of bed today? And why should anyone care? As a result, we think, act, and communicate from the outside-in of the Golden Circle: we tell people what to do, how we think we&rsquo;re different or better, and then we expect a behavior - a purchase.</p>\n<p>But all great leaders think, act, and communicate from the inside out - they all start with &lsquo;why&rsquo;. Apple, for example, follows the principles of the Golden Circle, and that earns them the ability to inspire innovation and loyalty. If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them would start with what, then try to differentiate with how. But here&rsquo;s how Apple actually communicates: &ldquo;In all we do, we believe in thinking differently - we challenge the status quo by making our products beautifully designed and simple to use. We just happen to make great computers.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a very different feeling - no manipulations - by starting with why. People don&rsquo;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it. What you do - your products and services - and how you communicate serve as the proof of what you believe.

I read this book in an afternoon&mdash;it jumped off the page and grabbed me (with apologies to all the work I ignored that day). Swora writes elegantly, with plenty of research and personal examples, about the challenges that all of us are currently facing at work. Change is constant. Our brains are wired to view change as a threat&mdash;and when our brains go into threat response mode, we shut down our capacity for creative problem solving. Swora offers an alternative: by creating more human workplaces we can build more resilient organizations.</p>\n<p>Rules of Engagement is a fantastic read, full of truly actionable insights. Swora does a masterful job of balancing the highly practical with the deeply personal. For anyone who leads or is a part of a team, this book is essential reading. Our current system&mdash;focusing on processes instead of people, expecting teams to do more with less without ever acknowledging the human toll that takes, an industrial era obsession with productivity&mdash;is broken. By understanding and embracing the Rules of Engagement, we can all have happier, healthier, more engaging experiences at work. Change is coming for us all. How we handle it will be a differentiating factor between the organizations that thrive, and those that get left behind.</p>\n<p><strong>INSIGHT #1</strong> <em>THE TRUST BOUNDARY</em></p>\n<p>Swora uses the metaphor of an iceberg to describe organizational culture. Above the &ldquo;waterline&rdquo; where the iceberg is visible, are things like results, behaviors, and processes. Below the waterline,&rdquo; or the part of the iceberg that can&rsquo;t be seen, are things like beliefs and values, identity, and purpose. The threshold which indicated the difference between the seen and unseen is called the Trust Boundary.</p>\n<p>However, the Trust Boundary is not fixed. Organizations that suffer from low-trust cultures will certainly be limited in what they can observe. But organizations with high trust are able to create increased visibility into things that usually remain hidden.</p>\n<p>Just about every organization has a values statement. Most of them languish in the company handbook in a drawer somewhere, or are written on the boardroom wall, mostly forgotten. In those cases, the values that drive employees are hidden, not likely to align with the values the company aspires to. At Actionable, our values are front and center: at our monthly town hall, we start with 10 minutes of shout outs to team members who have lived our values. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a coincidence that our work environment comes with a high degree of trust and authenticity&mdash;I feel like I can bring my whole self to work with me everyday.</p>\n<p>In these VUCA times, trust is essential. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to take a leap when you know that there&rsquo;s a safety net in place. Knowing that you have a team in place that will help you expand your thinking means that you have the freedom to be creative and flexible&mdash;which is exactly what your organization needs to stay agile in times of rapid change.</p>\n<p><strong>INSIGHT #2</strong> <em>HONOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT</em></p>\n<p>The psychological contract is a lot like organizational culture&mdash;hard to pin down, even harder to change, and yet present in every interaction. An employee who is used to feeling that their ideas are valued will have a hard time adjusting to a new manager who shoots down new ideas. An individual who is used to working from home a few days a week will not be pleased to learn that they have to be onsite 9-5 everyday after a change in policy.</p>\n<p>Change is inevitable. When VUCA hits, teams need happy, engaged employees to thrive. Just be careful that you respect the psychological contract while you&rsquo;re managing change. Have a look at the makeup of your team, and make a list of the &ldquo;unwritten&rdquo; rules of your workplace. Some of those norms may need to be adjusted as you tackle the difficulties of change&mdash;just be careful to go slow, and be aware of the impact on employees. The day you ask everyone to put in some extra hours for a big project is not a great day to change your remote working policy. And the few weeks it will take to get used to a new process or piece of software are not the same weeks you should be radically changing your meeting structure.</p>\n<p><strong>The Four Rules of Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>Many organizations have been built using industrial models for productivity, and outdated thoughts about how to structure teams and hierarchies. Ironically, these systems focus almost exclusively on results&mdash;meeting targets, improving efficiency, and doing more with less. However, in our VUCA world (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous), this focus on process over people creates ineffective workplace cultures, employee burnout, and sagging engagement&mdash;which in turn effects results.</p>\n<p>Swora identifies four &ldquo;Rules of Engagement&rdquo; to help organizations learn to focus on the people&mdash;not the process&mdash;that will drive them to success in our current business landscape, and create a Purposeful Work Experience&trade;.</p>\n<ol>\n <li>The Rule of Connection Instead of focusing on metrics, efficiency, or productivity, leaders should focus on purpose, identity, beliefs, and values&mdash;for the organization as a whole, and for the individuals who work within it. We all want to feel that we belong. And individuals who feel that they belong are more likely to show up enthusiastically and authentically&mdash;and create better results in the process.</li>\n <li>The Rule of Collaboration People are far more likely to respond to change in an effective way if they have been involved in the decision making process. They are also more likely to be effective and authentic when ideas have been generated in an environment that encourages a diversity of thought.</li>\n <li>The Rule of Adaptability The ability to deviate from a tactical plan helps to differentiate between organizations that thrive, and those that become cautionary tales (Blockbuster, anyone?). Something is going to go wrong. It&rsquo;s just a matter of what (and when)&mdash;so being willing and ready to change tactics in the moment, while staying true to your overall strategy, is a competitive advantage.</li>\n <li>The Rule of Equivalence Typically, organizations give a lot of attention to senior leaders. The higher up the org chart, the more learning and development invested, the more authority, the more gravitas. But VUCA isn&rsquo;t a management issue, it&rsquo;s an everyone issue. Everyone can be a leader if you treat them equally.</li>\n</ol>",

They redefine the terms of competition by embracing one-of-a-kind ideas in a world filled with me-too thinking.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to do&mdash;which is why so few organizations ever truly break from the pack and deliver outsized results. Here are four of those principles &mdash; simple rules for transforming your company, shaking up your industry, and challenging yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>RULE #1</strong> <em>What you see shapes how you change.</em></p>\n<p>Or, to use a term that's become popular in creativity circles, the best leaders demonstrate a capacity for vuja d&eacute;. We've all experienced d&eacute;j&agrave; vu &mdash; looking at an unfamiliar situation and feeling like you've seen it before. Vuja d&eacute; is the flip side of that: looking at a familiar situation (an industry you've worked in for decades, products you've worked on for years) as if you've never seen it before, and, with that fresh perspective, developing a distinctive point of view on the future.</p>\n<p><strong>RULE #2</strong> <em>Where you look shapes what you see.</em></p>\n<p>The most creative leaders I've met don't aspire to learn from the \"best in class\" in their industry &mdash; especially when best in class isn't all that great. Instead, they aspire to learn from innovators far outside their industry as a way to shake things up and leapfrog the competition. Ideas that are routine in one industry can be revolutionary when they migrate to another industry, especially when those ideas challenge the prevailing assumptions that define so many industries.</p>\n<p><strong>RULE #3</strong> <em>There's nothing wrong with your organization that can't be fixed by what's right with your organization.</em></p>\n<p>There's a difference between making change and breaking with the past. For even the most determined change agents, history and tradition can be unrivaled sources of strength &mdash; as the foundation for an enduring sense of purpose that newcomers can't begin to copy; as a reservoir of professional wisdom that gets more valuable as times get more volatile; as an engine of expertise that competitors can't hope to match; as a reminder of founding principles that never go out of style, regardless of how styles change.</p>\n<p><strong>RULE #4</strong> <em>Success is not just about thinking differently from the competition.</em></p>\n<p>It is also about caring more than the competition. In his inspiring book Rules of Thumb, my friend and Fast Company cofounder Alan Webber identifies two questions that demand the attention of leaders. The first is familiar: What keeps you up at night? What are the problems that nag at you? The second is less familiar, but even more important: What gets you up in the morning? What keeps you and your people more committed than ever, more engaged than ever, more excited than ever, particularly as the environment around you gets tougher and more demanding than ever?</p>\n<p>That's a question every organization needs to ask and answer if it hopes to prosper in an era of hyper-competition and nonstop dislocation. For leaders, the pressing question isn't just what separates you from the competition in the marketplace. It's also what holds you together in the workplace.</p>\n<p>There's nothing quite as exhilarating as watching a young organization reshape its field &mdash; a blank-sheet-of-paper startup that transforms an industry, a challenger brand that redefines a market.</p>\n<p>Alas, there's nothing quite as common as watching an established organization &mdash; a company that reached great heights in one era of technology, markets, and culture &mdash; struggle to regain its stature as a force for leadership in a new era.</p>\n<p>The work of deep-seated, sustainable change remains the hardest work there is. But that&rsquo;s the work we&rsquo;ve all signed up for, that&rsquo;s what it means to be a leader today. I hope these simple principles will help you do that work.</p>",

      "description": "<p>We must tell ourselves that &lsquo;we can do hard things,&rsquo; and we are not our decisions nor our conditions. In the end, we must also remember that &lsquo;we can do great things&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Dr. Robyne Hanley-Dafoe provided an insightful presentation on resiliency and wellness. She began her talk with the idea that just because we carry it well, doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t heavy. It is not our individual job to make our difficult moments look easy. We must recognize that we are not all at the same place in readiness to face challenging situations. Everyone has a story, and while some of our colleagues may be at the &lsquo;green light&rsquo; stage of being ready to tackle a problem, many of us are still in the &lsquo;yellow light&rsquo; stage waiting for the right conditions. The rest are stuck at a &lsquo;red light&rsquo; and not ready to proceed.</p>\n<p>Dr. Hanley-Dafoe explained that resiliency is often weaponized against us when we are told to &lsquo;just be more resilient.&rsquo; Instead, we should shift our perspective to understand that we can still be well in an unwell time. It is ok to feel good; and when we do, we tend to make better choices. She explained why some people give up versus get up in difficult times. In order to foster resiliency, she taught us five key themes noting that even if we are not raised with these tenets, they can be both taught and cultivated:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Belonging: we need someone in our corner who allows us to be us</li>\n <li>Perspective: our head and heart should be in alignment</li>\n <li>Acceptance: recognize what is in our control</li>\n <li>Hope: it is a strategy</li>\n <li>Humour: laughing blocks pain receptors giving us temporary relief</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We were reminded that the barrier to resiliency is stress. When stress becomes detrimental, we cross the threshold into &lsquo;distress.&rsquo; This leads us to the idea of being chronically tired versus exhausted. Exhaustion leads to burnout, and that burnout is often a curse of the strong. To deal with stress, Dr. Robyne employs us to:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Get outside</li>\n <li>Cry</li>\n <li>Eat carbohydrates (which metabolize cortisol)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we should reflect on our &lsquo;emotional home&rsquo;, whether that be anger, worry or chaos. We must remember that we will never have enough of what we do not need, and we therefore try to re-create patterns to reinstate our emotional home and make better choices. To reinstate our emotional home to a place of psychological safety, we must:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Have the freedom to be us</li>\n <li>Honour our lived experiences</li>\n <li>Be kept safe from harm, reprisal and rejection and know that we can have our needs met</li>\n <li>Realize that there are better days ahead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To develop our resiliency, we can take some concrete steps:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Be accountable and follow through</li>\n <li>Be transparent and clarify what matters most</li>\n <li>Foster community (who are invisible and valuable contributors - build loyalty)</li>\n <li>Feedback &ndash; value of connect before you correct. Listen, offer advice or intervene, but check expectations rather than jumping into fixing a problem</li>\n <li>Courage to intervene (letting bad behaviour go unaddressed sucks good behaviour)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We were taught about &lsquo;birthday cake breathing,&rsquo; or taking a breath in and blowing out our imagined birthday candles, which helps regulate our nervous system and quiet mental chatter. Dr. Robyne leaves us with some wise practices to engage in to help us feel better:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Solitude</li>\n <li>Connection with others</li>\n <li>Nature</li>\n <li>Music</li>\n <li>Gratitude</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, we are reminded of the technique of &lsquo;light housing,&rsquo; focusing on how to build clarity by focusing on what matters most.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Fear holds so many people back from talking about or tackling racism. So I started using this technique.</p>\n<p>Imagine you and your friend are playing a video game, the goal of which is to make it through a series of challenges as fast as possible. Playing side by side, you set out at the fairly easy level 2, and she starts at the much harder level 8. Playing at a much higher level, she faces a greater number of obstacles, significantly more difficult than any of those that you do &mdash; there are fireballs coming out of nowhere, bigger and stronger dragons to defeat. But after an hour of play, you both finish the game, reaching the goal at almost exactly same time.</p>\n<p>What would you conclude about your gaming skills? Given that she was able to finish as fast as you at a higher difficulty, you&rsquo;d likely make the logical conclusion that she was the more skilled player. If you were equal in skill, you would have finished well ahead of your friend.</p>\n<p>This is what we mean when we speak about white privilege. Some people start the game of life on easier settings, while others face more hurdles &mdash; due to such social determinants as health, wealth and number of other factors, including race. And someone equally skilled, facing more challenges, can&rsquo;t finish as fast or get as far. Does this mean that everyone who starts at level 1 or 2 will win? No. But they have far fewer obstacles standing in their way. As noted by sociologist Robin Di Angelo, a white woman whose work focuses on white people&rsquo;s resistance to discussing racism, &ldquo;yes, white people can have problems and face barriers, but systematic racism won&rsquo;t be one of them.&ldquo; We&rsquo;re not saying that white people can&rsquo;t have a hard life, or problems. But, those problems do not arise because they are white.</p>\n<p>I write, conduct research, and consult on issues related to gender and race in the workplace. And when I give presentations to companies on gender and race, I often use this video game analogy as a way to start conversations about race, privilege and systemic disadvantage. It&rsquo;s really hard to get people to understand what it is like to be a person of colour at work. People have a tough time addressing problems they don&rsquo;t see, haven&rsquo;t experienced or can&rsquo;t see clearly, especially when they are baked into the everyday minutiae of our procedures and processes.</p>\n<p>I can show countless graphs and stats from studies that show the reality of bias in the workplace. For instance, when people of colour remove race related information from their resumes, their likelihood of getting an interview goes up. Or the study that showed that a white man with a criminal record received significantly more call backs than a black man without one. But statistics often aren&rsquo;t enough. Usually, after showing several slides of studies and statistics, I ask people to put their hands up if they were aware of these, or unsurprised. Most hands go up. I then ask if their companies do anything to counter these effects. Most hands come down. We&rsquo;ve known the numbers, the differential outcomes for Emily and Akilah, we&rsquo;ve known the financial advantages of diversity for years, yet it never seems to be enough to prompt action and meaningfully move the needle.<br />\nFear holds so many people, in many cases good people, back from talking about or tackling these issues. There&rsquo;s fear of loss, fear of offending, fear of saying the wrong thing, fear of bad outcomes, fear of making mistakes, fear of being an ally, even. The distress that results can be thought of as privilege distress, and it is a sticky and complicated feeling that needs to be addressed, given that it is often felt by those currently holding power.</p>\n<p>It is this unnamed, unaddressed fear that is one of the forces holding us back. It&rsquo;s also incredibly common, one of the reasons why Di Angelo has been able to point to specific, almost universal reactions that happen whenever you try to have meaningful discussions about race, reactions she has coined white fragility in her book of the same name.</p>\n<p>So, what can you do to address these fears and improve inclusion in the workplace if you are a white woman? First, think critically about what you fear, and honestly assess whether it is based in fact or imagination. One thing I have my presentation participants do is write some of their fears anonymously, shuffle them up, read them out loud randomly, and discuss as a group. Write some of your fears down. Sit with them. Unpack them.</p>\n<p>Educate yourself about the very real challenges faced by women of colour in the workplace, and the difficulties we face in talking about them. Two great places to start are So You Want To Talk About Race, by Ijeoma Oluo, and Robin di Angelo&rsquo;s previously mentioned White Fragility. Understanding the issues and how to talk about them is key to addressing unfounded fears.</p>\n<p>Finally, this Black history month, and all the months afterwards, listen. Pipe up when you hear or see injustice, subtle digs, or overt ones. Address biased comments in the moment. Because when I speak up, I am &ldquo;too sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;the angry Black woman.&rdquo; You are seen as neutral. Your words, your disapproval or displeasure in those moments will carry more weight than mine.</p>\n<p>And please, don&rsquo;t do it for cookies and claps on the back, because you are just doing the bare minimum, what you should have always been doing. A true ally doesn&rsquo;t need to tell people that they are one. A true ally shows that they are, with their actions. A true ally feels the fear and faces it anyway.</p>\n<p>Listen to the experiences of others, without judgment, without stepping in, and without making it about you and your allyship. When you hear these voices being talked over, use your voice to make others quiet, so they can be heard.</p>",

Your words, your disapproval or displeasure in those moments will carry more weight than mine.</p>\n<p>And please, don&rsquo;t do it for cookies and claps on the back, because you are just doing the bare minimum, what you should have always been doing. A true ally doesn&rsquo;t need to tell people that they are one. A true ally shows that they are, with their actions. A true ally feels the fear and faces it anyway.</p>\n<p>Listen to the experiences of others, without judgment, without stepping in, and without making it about you and your allyship. When you hear these voices being talked over, use your voice to make others quiet, so they can be heard.</p>"

      "description": "<p>We are complex beings. We are feeling-factories who entertain over 65,000 thoughts per day. It takes a herculean effort to balance our emotional lives when we also factor in impulses, urges, drives, lived experiences, pressures, a boss, with a side of occupational loneliness while also celebrating our familial roles, pets, oh and getting ready for the spring holidays! And yet, we still strive for a clean house too.</p>\n<p>1. AFTER-ACTION-REPORT<br />\nHonour and recognize not only what you&rsquo;ve gone through but what you have grown through. List the things you&rsquo;ve discovered and learned about yourself these last 2 years. Celebrate it all.</p>\n<p>2. SMALL WINS<br />\nSimply start where you can. I sur- rendered my need for a clean house to a clean kitchen, and it has done wonders! Who says this needs to look or be done this way? Challenge the belief that ev- erything needs to be in order and perfect. Hold standards, not ideals.</p>\n<p>3. ASK FOR HELP<br />\nThere is no shame in asking for help when the weight of your world cannot be supported with your two hands. It may be hard to receive when we are in a constant state of doing and giving. Some may feel like it is easier just to do it yourself than explain to someone how to help. Pick your priorities and let the other things be good enough for now. There will be no ribbons for those who learned how to make sourdough bread, won Wordle, or Marie Kondo&rsquo;d their closets. We need regulated people, not perfection.</p>\n<p>4. TAKE MICRO-BREAKS<br />\nThere is no one coming to res- cue us. We also don&rsquo;t need saving. We need 5 minutes in solitude to drink a hot coffee or time to listen to a great podcast that helps name what we feel and inspires us to keep going. Take 5 when and wherever you can. Model- ling this for our children is a second- ary bonus. Show them by your actions, not your words, had to self-regulate.</p>\n<p>5. HOLD EMPATHY FOR YOURSELF AS YOU WOULD FOR OTHERS<br />\nPlease share that with yourself as you show kindness and gratitude for others. By showing empathy and compassion for ourselves, it can then flow onto oth- ers. You are entitled to a bad day. That doesn&rsquo;t make you an ungrateful person. Remember, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are drowning in 2 feet of water, or 10 feet of water, you still need to come up for air. Your life depends on it.</p>\n<p>6. RECOGNIZE DUAL TRUTHS<br />\nYou can love your life and need to cry. You can love your job and fantasize about owning an animal sanctuary. You can love your family and need time alone. Living in the extremes is small real-estate, there is much more room in the middle!</p>\n<p>7. HONOUR ALL THE BEHAVIOURS!<br />\nEven those maladaptive behaviours that are helping you cope; Thank you Net- flix, rompers, pets, chocolate, venting sessions with that dear friend and Ted Lasso. Every behaviour serves a purpose. You do not have to fix anything or every- thing today or ever. You don&rsquo;t have to grow, heal, and achieve every second of your life. There is a remarkable change when we show grace and perhaps a wee bit of mercy for ourselves.</p>\n<p>8. GO FOR THE ONE THING EVERYDAY<br />\nChoose one thing to do, per day, that makes you feel like you are living your values and then make this non-nego- tiable. Maybe it is reading a story to a child, or supporting local businesses, or taking your dog for a walk, or sending a thank you email. Each day make sure that ONE thing is getting done. Often our value-based behaviours fall to the bottom of the never-ending list.</p>\n<p>9. RECOGNIZE THE LIMITS OF OUR BIOLOGY<br />\nThe function of our nervous system is to keep us alive, not happy. We need to purposely create moments of joy, ease, and pleasure. While feelings of anxiety, fear and avoidance are automatic, add- ing good feelings take more effort. To hold hope is a skill. Look for precious moments in a noisy world.</p>\n<p>10. MAKE WHAT MATTERS MOST, MATTER MOST, UNAPOLOGETICALLY<br />\nWe are replaceable in most of our profes- sional roles. Invest in the roles in your life where you are irreplaceable. Don&rsquo;t miss the phone call with a loved one or that basketball game or cheer competition. Show up. When all else fails show up for your loved ones and yourself.</p>\n<p>You may have also brought a fruit roll-up to this knife fight, but thankfully we are using our words, and it looks like we are going to walk away from this alive! You are here. You have the right to be well and feel good. Consider this your permission slip to feel well even in challenging seasons. As we work towards improving systems and re-imagining our professional roles, we can also look after ourselves, for our own benefit. This isn&rsquo;t selfish, its science. When you feel better, you do better. You are your decisions, not your conditions. Make the decision to be well in this unwell world as we co-create a better future for all.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

It might stop the bleed for a millisecond, but the injury needs a proper intervention. As a scholar of resiliency and wellness, I am deeply concerned with how resiliency and wellness are being weaponized.</p>\n<p>Amid systems of corruption and deconstruction, plus social injustices, telling people to just be more resilient or up their self-care is cruel. The reality is that organizations, systems, and companies need also carry some responsibility in addressing the demands on their people. The demands are rising, and our supply of self-care is not proportionate. Professional care is also needed. Self-care is what we bring. Professional care is what an organization can do to mediate and address the stressors. There needs to be a shared responsibility for taking care of the worlds we work and live in.</p>\n<p>THE PACE OF CRISIS LIVING COMES AT A COST<br />\nWe have experienced living for more than two years in a crisis, yet many of our professional and personal roles and responsibilities still have us in the early crisis pace and mode. People are on high alert in the immediate aftermath of a crisis; change and responsive action are required. We are not future- focused. We are surviving at the moment and trying everything to minimize the blast radius. With all that is being asked of us, our plates are broken from the weight of everything, and now the platter we are balancing is starting to overflow too. Our nervous system is under-developed for the task at hand. The system is in a constant state of threat and survival. Our emotions are relentless, our brains are sizzling from overwhelm yet we feel pressure to make all this living look easy. When did we pick up this ideal that professional people are meant to make their lives effortless? Living is not effortless. It is complex, messy, and ever-changing. And perhaps, just when we think we are hitting our stride, the ugliness of humanity takes centre stage again.</p>\n<p>We have moved from juggling watermelons blindfolded to juggling chainsaws on fire. I recently commented in a presentation that I feel as though I have brought a fruit roll-up to a knife fight. And in the weariness of our brains sizzling, our children missing key milestones, and being in another wave of an even more contagious virus, WE feel we are not doing enough. We believe we are not resilient. Or maybe we are just tired of being resilient or living in systems that require this degree and scope of resiliency to cope.</p>\n<p>THE PERPETUAL LOOP OF WAITING UNTIL MONDAY TO START<br />\nAs a behaviorist, I have a deep appreciation for the use of tools and strategies to help people adapt, cope, learn, and grow. I can also read the room, and I know the last thing people want right now is to do more. So, here is my invitation, let&rsquo;s try to take small, consistent, and purposeful steps towards looking after ourselves as we continue to work on regulating a hurting and broken world. Give yourself permission to co-exist with dual truths. The world is a scary place, and I am safe. This is for you to start to hold hope again. To believe that we will weather this storm and look after ourselves in the process. Better days are ahead. We must fiercely protect this belief for ourselves and one another.</p>\n<p>I invite you to give yourself permission to start feeling good again where you can, during this season of uncertainty and change, not waiting until afterwards to start getting back to those good feelings and thoughts. We are in a perpetual loop of waiting until Monday to feel better. This is a false promise we convince ourselves is true. Once I feel better, and the world is better, then I will be okay. This &lsquo;when-then&rdquo; mindset keeps us stuck. It is now that counts. You cannot outthink stress. To do this work, we must acknowledge and validate that we have some unlearning to do. We must feel our way back to good now, not when.</p>\n<p>DIRECTION MATTERS &ndash; HOPE-FORWARD<br />\nTake a moment to reflect on how many broken promises you have made with yourself. I will feel better once everything is back to &lsquo;normal&rsquo;, there is no normal, just new familiars, yet you are still not feeling better. I will get up earlier tomorrow to go for a walk, then don&rsquo;t. I will take a lunch break today, then work right through it. These broken promises to ourselves matter. We need to acknowledge that we may not have always had the best history with change or improving our emotional state, yet we can. There is no shame here. Building awareness and having a plan to point yourself in the direction you wish to travel is paramount. Creating realistic systems and habits will make a difference. You need to hold a vision of your desired emotional state. Right now, many of us are looking where we DON&rsquo;T want to go, wondering why we are heading in that direction. Just like in white water rafting, don&rsquo;t look where you don&rsquo;t want to go, or you will inevitably paddle yourself to that very spot. Focus on being well in your &lsquo;here and now&rsquo; body and mind. We must hope-forward while being present. Self- awareness really is a super-skill in uncertain seasons.</p>\n<p>We must find a way to be okay DURING the change season. This is for you, not the establishment. And what is terrific about this truth is that when you start feeling better, our perspective shifts from threat-tunnel focus to broader views, increasing problem-solving, critical thinking and innovation. And that is the mindset we need to solve the problems that are plaguing us right now. Steady yourself in a hope-forward mindset.</p>\n<p>What are some of my program&rsquo;s wise practices that can accomplish this?</p>",

      "description": "<p>Jody Wilson-Raybould most recently served as the independent Member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville. The following is excerpted from her latest book, &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; in the Cabinet: Speaking Truth to Power.</p>\n<p>Soon after the swearing-in on Nov. 4, 2015, government continued to reinforce how positive this moment could be. The mandate letters were being finalized, and that was exciting. It was the first time that such letters &ndash; which detail what the Prime Minister is expecting of his ministers &ndash; would be made public. Much of the talk around the letters was great, and many of the orientation messages were music to my ears: &ldquo;Politics is a secondary role we play&rdquo;; &ldquo;Science and the rule of law and the Constitution must be woven through everything we do&rdquo;; &ldquo;We must demonstrate the impact of how we spend taxpayer money&rdquo;; &ldquo;We must be open-minded about all different perspectives&rdquo;; &ldquo;Restoring Cabinet government, making decisions that reflect a team effort, will lead to better decisions&rdquo;; &ldquo;With politics we need to learn humility.&rdquo; This was great stuff. I remember one day when we left a meeting, public servants were lined up clapping and cheering. They seemed so excited and relieved.</p>\n<p>In these early days, a senior PMO official made a statement in front of the Prime Minister, members of the government, and public servants that has always stuck with me. It would come to mind many times during my years as minister. &ldquo;The Prime Minister is your brand. You each serve at his pleasure. You each have a duty to country &ndash; and will need to at some point speak truth to power.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I took this to heart. I wrote it in my notebook with quotation marks around it. What I did not realize at the time is that I was not expected to take the last sentence seriously.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of getting to outcomes on big issues and making decisions, medical assistance in dying (MAID) and the legalization and regulation of cannabis were a success. Of course, people will have differing views about the policy decisions we made and what we did. That is always the case. But in terms of government functioning and process, of&nbsp;&nbsp; getting to results, it was pretty effective and one of the reasons I was proud of the government then.</p>\n<p>As for the internal dynamics, there were problems. But in this first year or so, when the hard work was done on MAID and cannabis, I thought that if this was as bad as it got we could find our way through anything.</p>\n<p>I was even willing to put up with the casual racism and misogyny that I&rsquo;d known would be present in government, and indeed was present. I&rsquo;d so hoped this would not be the case. All too typically, it would often take a white male minister to repeat or vouch for what I had just said, particularly on Indigenous rights and social justice issues, before I felt folks would listen. Of course, there were also the expressions of surprise at how I was not what certain people imagined an Indigenous person would be like. I remember vividly the first conversation I had with one of my cabinet colleagues, who exclaimed to me that I was the first Indigenous person she had ever met. It remains a reality that I, like so many women, had to tolerate a certain level of ignorance in order to get to the outcomes I wanted to achieve. But, of course, in life the real lessons come from unexpected places.</p>\n<p>While I certainly had some successes, there were an increasing number of red flags around what was not happening. Vitally important issues &ndash; my priorities<br />\n&ndash; would be interfered with and delayed more and more. On issues in which I had first-hand and lifelong experience, the PMO seemed to insist they knew better. In addressing racism and the legacy of colonization, and in tackling over representation of Black, Indigenous and other marginalized people in the justice system, I was told time and again to slow down. The PMO knew what was right. From my perspective, the message I was getting was: Approve a pipeline first.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly these delays and lack of will, on the part of the PMO, to take action on these critical issues was the root of some real tensions that were building. I frustrated them and they frustrated me. I do think these tensions could have been managed and good results still been reached. But that can only happen when everyone is pursuing a shared goal of advancing decisions. It took me some time to realize this was not really the case. While I have no doubt that cabinet understood that Indigenous reconciliation and criminal justice reform are serious and challenging issues, over time I learned that they were not taken seriously from a political perspective. They do not drive people to the polls, are not often sources of partisan advantage, and frankly are rarely politically expedient. They are also hard to sell, hard to explain and hard to understand. So why do them?</p>\n<p>I was starting to see more clearly our government&rsquo;s answer to this question. Which is that we wouldn&rsquo;t do them. Like governments past, we would tinker around the margins, but mostly the plan was to stay with a mix of lofty rhetoric and little action. I did not accept this. My Indigenous schooling in relentlessness would not let me accept this. I wanted to keep making decisions, like we had on MAID and cannabis. I wanted this government to keep doing the hard things that made people&rsquo;s lives better. So I pushed. And I pushed more. And for some I obviously pushed too much.</p>\n<p>Central to my teachings is the idea that we are all human and all part of an interconnected human reality. It is a fact of history that humanity has divided itself, often violently and oppressively, on racial lines. Addressing racism is a necessary part of building conditions of justice that will allow humanity to once again recognize the ways in which it is fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. This is, I think, why I have dedicated much of my life to Indigenous rights, to overcoming this injustice, to calling out the violation of those rights.</p>\n<p>It is also why I responded as I did to the racism I experienced throughout my time in government. It infuriated me, though I think the smears that came after I was shuffled out of my role as Minister of Justice were more typical of being a woman than being Indigenous. It also hurt me. How blind they were to their own paternalism, to how much they embodied a colonial mindset. The constant attitude within government was that Indigenous peoples &ndash; not only me, but Indigenous peoples generally<br />\n&ndash; did not know what they need or what needed to be done. There was a constant insistence and insinuation that they knew best, and knew better, what Indigenous peoples need. I found this to be the attitude of some of my colleagues in government. I also found it to be the case for some parts of the public service. Of course, it had always been this way. This is at the heart of colonialism: We know better. Trust us. We do.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the shuffle, it was the fact that racist tropes would be trotted out, without a recognition of the racism, that really upset me. For example, there were cartoons of me bound and gagged with the Prime Minister being egged on to beat me, which is completely inappropriate given the reality of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG); another had me knocked out by the Prime Minister in a boxing ring; there was also one of me dressed like an Indigenous person wearing stereotypical &ldquo;buckskin&rdquo; clothes and feathers in my hair. Together, they showed me how far we still had to go as a country. That I truly was the &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; in the Cabinet. Separate. Apart. Different. And expendable, when not playing their game in their way. As Indigenous peoples have always been treated by governments in this country.</p>\n<p>But here is one thing about the sexist, racist tropes that were trotted out against me: They didn&rsquo;t accomplish much. In fact, I think they backfired. Far more people called out these pernicious acts than engaged in them. Those who knew me spoke out &ndash; Indigenous leaders and those who had worked with me; staff and others. But there were also so many I had never met who were just not having it. This included a lot of the media, who didn&rsquo;t buy the incompetence narrative that started the second I was shuffled. In fact, some in the media even apologized for their early reporting, and they deserve credit for this.</p>\n<p>So as I was grappling with real concerns about why the shuffle had happened, and with the terrible things that were being said, I was also reminded of how much progress we have made as a country. While the smears upset and hurt me, the overwhelmingly positive responses to them buoyed me. I am proud to be Canadian, and I was again shown why Canada continues to get stronger. I was also reminded of the importance of the sacrifices that so many have made, and continue to make, to build greater equality, inclusion and justice. As had been the case so many times over my years as minister, it was Canadians who picked me up and made me feel able to keep going on.</p>",

          "textOnly": "<p>Jody Wilson-Raybould most recently served as the independent Member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville. The following is excerpted from her latest book, &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; in the Cabinet: Speaking Truth to Power.</p>\n<p>Soon after the swearing-in on Nov. 4, 2015, government continued to reinforce how positive this moment could be. The mandate letters were being finalized, and that was exciting. It was the first time that such letters &ndash; which detail what the Prime Minister is expecting of his ministers &ndash; would be made public. Much of the talk around the letters was great, and many of the orientation messages were music to my ears: &ldquo;Politics is a secondary role we play&rdquo;; &ldquo;Science and the rule of law and the Constitution must be woven through everything we do&rdquo;; &ldquo;We must demonstrate the impact of how we spend taxpayer money&rdquo;; &ldquo;We must be open-minded about all different perspectives&rdquo;; &ldquo;Restoring Cabinet government, making decisions that reflect a team effort, will lead to better decisions&rdquo;; &ldquo;With politics we need to learn humility.&rdquo; This was great stuff. I remember one day when we left a meeting, public servants were lined up clapping and cheering. They seemed so excited and relieved.</p>\n<p>In these early days, a senior PMO official made a statement in front of the Prime Minister, members of the government, and public servants that has always stuck with me. It would come to mind many times during my years as minister. &ldquo;The Prime Minister is your brand. You each serve at his pleasure. You each have a duty to country &ndash; and will need to at some point speak truth to power.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I took this to heart. I wrote it in my notebook with quotation marks around it. What I did not realize at the time is that I was not expected to take the last sentence seriously.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of getting to outcomes on big issues and making decisions, medical assistance in dying (MAID) and the legalization and regulation of cannabis were a success. Of course, people will have differing views about the policy decisions we made and what we did. That is always the case. But in terms of government functioning and process, of&nbsp;&nbsp; getting to results, it was pretty effective and one of the reasons I was proud of the government then.</p>\n<p>As for the internal dynamics, there were problems. But in this first year or so, when the hard work was done on MAID and cannabis, I thought that if this was as bad as it got we could find our way through anything.</p>\n<p>I was even willing to put up with the casual racism and misogyny that I&rsquo;d known would be present in government, and indeed was present. I&rsquo;d so hoped this would not be the case. All too typically, it would often take a white male minister to repeat or vouch for what I had just said, particularly on Indigenous rights and social justice issues, before I felt folks would listen. Of course, there were also the expressions of surprise at how I was not what certain people imagined an Indigenous person would be like. I remember vividly the first conversation I had with one of my cabinet colleagues, who exclaimed to me that I was the first Indigenous person she had ever met. It remains a reality that I, like so many women, had to tolerate a certain level of ignorance in order to get to the outcomes I wanted to achieve. But, of course, in life the real lessons come from unexpected places.</p>\n<p>While I certainly had some successes, there were an increasing number of red flags around what was not happening. Vitally important issues &ndash; my priorities<br />\n&ndash; would be interfered with and delayed more and more. On issues in which I had first-hand and lifelong experience, the PMO seemed to insist they knew better. In addressing racism and the legacy of colonization, and in tackling over representation of Black, Indigenous and other marginalized people in the justice system, I was told time and again to slow down. The PMO knew what was right. From my perspective, the message I was getting was: Approve a pipeline first.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly these delays and lack of will, on the part of the PMO, to take action on these critical issues was the root of some real tensions that were building. I frustrated them and they frustrated me. I do think these tensions could have been managed and good results still been reached.

      "description": "<p>Choosing your path deliberately and joyfully allows you to discover, keep and even build energy to live and work. It&rsquo;s not our experiences, but who we are that matters. And guess what, we get to choose who we are - how we think about and represent ourselves, and how we learn from our good and bad experiences. When you know who you are, energy doesn&rsquo;t get depleted.</p>\n<p>Twelve tiny steps can generate the electric life you want. Not one of these microsteps is particularly difficult, but they will put you on a path to boundless energy - energy that is real and sustainable, to drive value into your everyday life, work, family and community.</p>\n<p>These twelve steps are divided into three parts:<br />\nPay Attention; Be Brilliant; Go Deep</p>\n<p><strong>Part i: Pay Attention</strong><br />\n<em>A guide for how to think about yourself, in three microsteps.</em></p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 1: Find Your Hurricane<br />\nWhen you &lsquo;show up&rsquo;, or are present, in body, mind and spirit, you create your own energetic atmosphere. Assess whether your BODY - your physical self - encourages or prevents connection. Whether your MIND - thoughts and concerns - is revealed to your colleagues. Whether your SPIRIT - passions and identity - is guiding your actions. Nurture your own hurricane of energy by keeping a list of your accomplishments, updating your resume, and honestly volunteering your ideas, questions and passions at work.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 2: Choose Your Balloon<br />\nLike the elasticity of a balloon, the way we interpret the information we receive will alter the way we understand any future event. Intentionally choosing how we think, what matters to us and what will define and represent who we are in the world comes down to making decisions about what you can gain, from both good and bad experiences. Consider how your balloon of life experience is altered by your environment, whether you have control of the conversations in your life, whether you&rsquo;re feeling engaged and valued in your interactions. Be curious - question where you are, and seek the other perspective.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 3: &ldquo;FINE&rdquo; Is Not a Feeling<br />\nHow are you, really? Being self-aware helps us to build emotional strength so that we can manage our discomfort and sit with it. People who understand and perceive their own emotions are better at understanding other people&rsquo;s body language, tone of voice and facial expressions. Connection, innovation, excitement,<br />\ntrue joy&hellip; all stem from the same source: honesty with ourselves. So forget &lsquo;fine&rsquo;, get real with yourself - how are you feeling? What makes you want to feel that way? How is that feeling affecting those around you?</p>\n<p><strong>Part ii: Be Brilliant</strong><br />\n<em>A guide for how to activate yourself, in five microsteps.</em></p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 4: Plug In<br />\nEnergy isn&rsquo;t created or destroyed, but we can tap into it. It starts with plugging in. This means being honest about where your energy is flowing right now. Remembering when (or if) you were passionate about your work, and making a choice to plug into areas that breathe life into you. Plugging in means being aware of how we exchange energy with others, and giving the energy we want to receive.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 5: Be Self-ful<br />\nDon&rsquo;t shy away from noticing yourself and, indeed, putting yourself first. Self-recognition allows you to imagine what&rsquo;s possible, to move into a growth mindset - to show up. Being self- ful, not selfish, starts with being attentive to your physical body, your mind and your spirit - nurture them every day. Build a foundation of respect for yourself to connect to what is meaningful to you and you alone. Challenge yourself to understand the energy you&rsquo;re leaving in the room.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 6: Power Your Curiosity<br />\nNot every workplace or leader is going to give us meaning and energy at work. Choosing to use your superhuman power of curiosity allows us to rethink habits, to approach the workplace in a different way, and to have fun. By no means does this ensure we avoid discomfort and challenges along the way, but it does ensure that we can and will make choices that feel good. Find ways to seek what you truly want from work, make it fun and let loose your curiosity.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 7: Celebrate Mis-takes<br />\nOur educational systems and workplaces have made us frightened of being wrong. Having the freedom to have made a &lsquo;mis-take&rsquo;, as opposed to the stigma of a mistake, allows us to learn through fun. By listening and thinking creatively, we find new and better ways of doing what we&rsquo;ve always done. There is strength in accepting that all of what makes us human is perfect in its imperfection.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 8: Practice Pausitivity<br />\nWhen we pretend that everything is okay when it&rsquo;s not, we lose the capacity to gain mutual trust, comfort and do damage to our mental health. &lsquo;Pausitivity&rsquo; is a chance to slow down and calm our monkey minds, to be grateful for what we have, to see things from someone else&rsquo;s point of view, to discover the truth and own it.</p>\n<p><strong>Part iii: Go Deep</strong><br />\n<em>A guide for how to engage with others, in four microsteps</em></p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 9: Show Me You<br />\nTruly seeing others and providing a space of psychological safety allows us to connect, innovate and reach peak experiences. Making every interaction a chance to make someone feel special, valued and important (SVI) allows us to invite a deep witnessing and presence with this other human. Foster belonging and connection by seeing people, noticing the things they care about, letting them know what you value in them, and creating a safe space without judgment.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 10: Live Giving<br />\nGiving as our authentic, true selves, expecting nothing in return, is the one true way to generate life-giving energy between two people, and allows us to imagine a different future for ourselves. To foster a shared and connected existence, don&rsquo;t give a present&hellip; be present. Giving in this way feels good, and gives us a chance to get what we want most from life.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 11: See the Back Row<br />\nMost of our focus is to see ourselves in the spotlight, whether under scrutiny or adulation of others. Yet that worldview can prevent us from looking farther than the end of the stage. Connecting with people energizes us when we find the link between our stories and our spirits, even with entirely different lived experiences. Avoiding RJF (resting jerk face), listening and asking questions, and finding the hidden voices and stories of others can give new meaning to our lives.</p>\n<p>MICROSTEP 12: Cross the River<br />\nConfluence is where points of view and interactions with others flow together, forever altering us. How they alter us is up to us. By bringing all of what we have learned together - the pure and the muddy waters of life - we can find our spirit energy and feel like a fully realized, whole person. An open mindset seeks to find what intrinsically motivates us, pays attention to what motivates others (without carrying their burden), and goes with that flow. Keep your river clean, and purify others&rsquo;.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

The fact is there are no boundaries that can be readily identified when you live the life of an entrepreneur. All lines are blurred. Your business is not regulated to the work you leave at the office. You thrive on living and breathing the business you are building. It is a whole package deal. Your business is your life and your life is your business, and most entrepreneurs wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way.</p>\n<p>To read a book by an author who lives in the same city as you brings with it an element of familiarity.

You need to know why you quit your day job, why you re-mortgaged the house, and why you are burning the midnight oil. Being able to answer this question in such a way that it becomes your personal mantra is what will be your anchor during the tough times. As the author says, &ldquo;You need to know up front that being an entrepreneur is demanding, rewarding, scary, and thrilling.&rdquo; The level of commitment required, especially when you face obstacles and the naysayers that will inevitably circle, is something of superhero proportions.

The best defense going in is anticipation and preparation. For example, she suggests that the biggest threat to an entrepreneur&rsquo;s marriage will be absence. So often an entrepreneur is at work, thinking about work, dreaming up new work, or seeking new work. Even if they are physically present, their mind may be still on the work and the cell phone will become an appendage. What to do?

There is a tremendous amount of pressure to achieve this thing called &ldquo;work /life&rdquo; balance. Arlene Dickinson says, in her charmingly blunt way, that it doesn&rsquo;t exist so stop feeling guilty about it. It took her many years to come to terms with this but it was very freeing once she did. She advises that you give yourself permission to see your work as a creative expression of who you are and that you love it. Once you give yourself this permission you can then find ways to incorporate your family, friends, and interests into your business life. Accept that life will be messy. Make being present wherever you are a priority. Find a way to be reliably, consistently reachable to those who need you at home no matter the time zone you are in. Celebrate the fact that this thing you call work is so completely what you want to be doing that you don&rsquo;t distinguish between it and your life. Most people are doing work they would never consider fulfilling if it was their entire life. Not so for the entrepreneur. This for them is the Holy Grail; the whole reason why they left their day job in the first place, to achieve the freedom to combine their work and life.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

In turbulent economic times, the same is true: the victor is determined by the smallest of margins.</p>\n<p>How, then, can you ensure you&rsquo;re standing on the winning platform?

Everything from the seemingly innocuous un-examined habit, through disorganization and trepidation, all the way to the flat out fear that paralyzes your thinking, not to mention your ability to act in your own best interest. For myself, I know that when I&rsquo;m off my game I tend to adopt the coping skills of Lucy Ricardo - changing what might have been a manageable situation into an operatic showdown at the Copacabana.</p>\n<p>Given this, over the years I&rsquo;ve discovered, developed, and learned from the brightest stars with whom I work, a number of ideas, habits, and tools that help me present my best self regardless of the circumstances. The tips and tools offered in How to Wow, then, are things you must do to fine tune how you show up every day -- mental weight lifting, if you will. And, in the same way those seemingly pointless bicep curls and leg presses you do in the gym day to day ensure you have the strength you need to carry your kids to safety if your house is on fire, these tips and tools will ensure you have the mental strength, technical acumen, and people skills you need when your interview gets moved from tomorrow to today, to stay off your C-level executives &ldquo;early retirement&rdquo; short list, and, ultimately, to grab that promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line of what I teach: regardless of the details of the situation, if you aren&rsquo;t getting the response you want, or expect, you need to look at your message and - just as importantly - at how you are expressing it. Often, with only a few small adjustments, you can go from a near miss to a slam dunk, from a &ldquo;that was nice&rdquo; presentation to one that knocks their socks off, from a mediocre meeting to one that fires up each and every participant.</p>\n<p>When you want to make a good impression no detail is too small. No amount of advance preparation is too much. No word choice is unimportant. The shirt you wear, the chair you sit in, the thank-you note you write afterward should all be carefully considered, and ultimately compound the impression of someone who&rsquo;s calm, confident, and in- command.</p>\n<p><strong>SMALL CHANGES, BIG DIFFERENCES</strong></p>\n<p><em>What are some examples of small changes with big differences?</em></p>\n<p>I was once called by a magazine to come in and speak to one of their editors. He was continuously tapped by television shows as the go-to guy for reviews of current movies. The trouble, though, was that none of the shows ever aired the tapes. The magazine couldn&rsquo;t understand it: he was smart, handsome, articulate&hellip;<br />\nThis is my idea of catnip. In I went. In came the client. He was indeed handsome. He shook hands with me, sat down, crossed one leg so his ankle was on his opposite knee, threw an arm over the chair&rsquo;s back, tilted himself way back, opened his mouth&hellip; My work was done. I knew what the stumbling block was. He was coming across as &ldquo;too cool for school.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s always important to be aware of your physicality - how you are taking up space. Leaning way back in your chair, throwing your arm over the back of your chair, putting one ankle on top of your other knee so you give your listener a crotch shot, all &ldquo;reads&rdquo; for your viewer as &ldquo;I am way too cool to be here.&rdquo; It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say after that - your listener has a distorted impression of you.</p>\n<p>Although we worked on some messaging, etc. that day, my primary advice to him was to keep both his feet on the floor, his hands where I could see them, lean in toward his interviewer, and smile. The result? The very next piece that he taped got used. He was thrilled.</p>\n<p>His bosses were thrilled. And I&rsquo;m sure (if you&rsquo;re a movie-goer) you are thrilled because he gives great advice about going to the movies.</p>\n<p><em>What&rsquo;s another example of a small change with a big difference?</em></p>\n<p>One day I got a call from a client who had just been promoted a mid-level manager to a top spot. I asked them if there was anything in particular I should be aware of. Well, they said, he&rsquo;s smart and enthusiastic - which is great, but we&rsquo;re worried he doesn&rsquo;t come across as &lsquo;manager material.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Next, I called his office to make an appointment. Here&rsquo;s what his voicemail message sounded like: &ldquo;Hi.This. Is.Joe.I&rsquo;m.Not.Here.Leave.A.Message. Or.Call.Lewis.At.212&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Instead of sounding competent, calm, and in command, he sounded like he was trying to find his way out of a burning building.</p>\n<p>Was it Joe&rsquo;s goal to come across this way? Of course not. It was simply that no one had ever told him how important this seemingly small detail was to the overall impression he left behind. Although we worked on a lot in his session, we began by re-recording his voice mail message. Now, if you should call, you&rsquo;ll hear a message that&rsquo;s authoritative, warm and welcoming manager material, which he is.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO USE HOW TO WOW</strong></p>\n<p>How to Wow offers hundreds of examples from my&nbsp;&nbsp; years&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; work in the public presentation arena. I present these not in chapters, but in a one to two page &ldquo;search-and-destroy&rdquo; format to make it easy for you to find the information needed in your situation - meeting, lunch, cold call, PowerPoint presentation - so you can begin employing it, and enjoying the benefits of it, immediately.</p>\n<p>There are no &ldquo;rules&rdquo; because I recognize that each of you comes to the table with a unique set of attributes and circumstances. More importantly, I know each of you is smart enough to know what will work for you and your circumstances: what will help give you the confidence to speak your mind in a meeting, motivate your team under deadline, or negotiate your business deal over pasta puttanesca.</p>\n<p>I will know I&rsquo;ve succeeded when you begin to doubt your doubts - to be confident in your confidence. Because when you are, you are free to be enthusiastic, committed, authentic.</p>\n<p>The you that you know yourself to be when you&rsquo;re at your best.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

The tips and tools offered in How to Wow, then, are things you must do to fine tune how you show up every day -- mental weight lifting, if you will. And, in the same way those seemingly pointless bicep curls and leg presses you do in the gym day to day ensure you have the strength you need to carry your kids to safety if your house is on fire, these tips and tools will ensure you have the mental strength, technical acumen, and people skills you need when your interview gets moved from tomorrow to today, to stay off your C-level executives &ldquo;early retirement&rdquo; short list, and, ultimately, to grab that promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line of what I teach: regardless of the details of the situation, if you aren&rsquo;t getting the response you want, or expect, you need to look at your message and - just as importantly - at how you are expressing it. Often, with only a few small adjustments, you can go from a near miss to a slam dunk, from a &ldquo;that was nice&rdquo; presentation to one that knocks their socks off, from a mediocre meeting to one that fires up each and every participant.</p>\n<p>When you want to make a good impression no detail is too small. No amount of advance preparation is too much. No word choice is unimportant. The shirt you wear, the chair you sit in, the thank-you note you write afterward should all be carefully considered, and ultimately compound the impression of someone who&rsquo;s calm, confident, and in- command.</p>\n<p><strong>SMALL CHANGES, BIG DIFFERENCES</strong></p>\n<p><em>What are some examples of small changes with big differences?</em></p>\n<p>I was once called by a magazine to come in and speak to one of their editors. He was continuously tapped by television shows as the go-to guy for reviews of current movies. The trouble, though, was that none of the shows ever aired the tapes. The magazine couldn&rsquo;t understand it: he was smart, handsome, articulate&hellip;<br />\nThis is my idea of catnip. In I went. In came the client. He was indeed handsome. He shook hands with me, sat down, crossed one leg so his ankle was on his opposite knee, threw an arm over the chair&rsquo;s back, tilted himself way back, opened his mouth&hellip; My work was done. I knew what the stumbling block was. He was coming across as &ldquo;too cool for school.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s always important to be aware of your physicality - how you are taking up space. Leaning way back in your chair, throwing your arm over the back of your chair, putting one ankle on top of your other knee so you give your listener a crotch shot, all &ldquo;reads&rdquo; for your viewer as &ldquo;I am way too cool to be here.&rdquo; It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say after that - your listener has a distorted impression of you.</p>\n<p>Although we worked on some messaging, etc. that day, my primary advice to him was to keep both his feet on the floor, his hands where I could see them, lean in toward his interviewer, and smile. The result? The very next piece that he taped got used. He was thrilled.</p>\n<p>His bosses were thrilled. And I&rsquo;m sure (if you&rsquo;re a movie-goer) you are thrilled because he gives great advice about going to the movies.</p>\n<p><em>What&rsquo;s another example of a small change with a big difference?</em></p>\n<p>One day I got a call from a client who had just been promoted a mid-level manager to a top spot. I asked them if there was anything in particular I should be aware of. Well, they said, he&rsquo;s smart and enthusiastic - which is great, but we&rsquo;re worried he doesn&rsquo;t come across as &lsquo;manager material.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Next, I called his office to make an appointment. Here&rsquo;s what his voicemail message sounded like: &ldquo;Hi.This. Is.Joe.I&rsquo;m.Not.Here.Leave.A.Message. Or.Call.Lewis.At.212&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Instead of sounding competent, calm, and in command, he sounded like he was trying to find his way out of a burning building.</p>\n<p>Was it Joe&rsquo;s goal to come across this way? Of course not. It was simply that no one had ever told him how important this seemingly small detail was to the overall impression he left behind. Although we worked on a lot in his session, we began by re-recording his voice mail message. Now, if you should call, you&rsquo;ll hear a message that&rsquo;s authoritative, warm and welcoming manager material, which he is.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO USE HOW TO WOW</strong></p>\n<p>How to Wow offers hundreds of examples from my&nbsp;&nbsp; years&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; work in the public presentation arena. I present these not in chapters, but in a one to two page &ldquo;search-and-destroy&rdquo; format to make it easy for you to find the information needed in your situation - meeting, lunch, cold call, PowerPoint presentation - so you can begin employing it, and enjoying the benefits of it, immediately.</p>\n<p>There are no &ldquo;rules&rdquo; because I recognize that each of you comes to the table with a unique set of attributes and circumstances. More importantly, I know each of you is smart enough to know what will work for you and your circumstances: what will help give you the confidence to speak your mind in a meeting, motivate your team under deadline, or negotiate your business deal over pasta puttanesca.</p>\n<p>I will know I&rsquo;ve succeeded when you begin to doubt your doubts - to be confident in your confidence. Because when you are, you are free to be enthusiastic, committed, authentic.</p>\n<p>The you that you know yourself to be when you&rsquo;re at your best.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

      "description": "<p>For several years, Rick, a friend of mine from my Yahoo days, had a typical twenty first century morning routine. When he woke up - usually springing out of bed right after he slapped his alarm off - he fired up the coffee pot and booted his laptop. He downloaded his emails, many of which had come in earlier that morning from the East Coast. He&rsquo;d answer a few, fill his coffee cup, and weed-whack through the rest. After that, he&rsquo;d hit the homepage of Yahoo, and a few blogs he followed, and then graze. Often he&rsquo;d get sucked into a social-networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter until he realized that he was running late for work.</p>\n<p>As he drove to work, he listened to morning talk radio, much of it either crude or political. While he waited at stoplights, he checked his email on his phone or answered texts from coworkers. At lunch, he worked out in the gym while watching CNBC and then pored over the newspaper while he ate. In the evening, he watched the evening news over dinner, and following that, a slew of reality shows or sitcoms.</p>\n<p>After dinner he&rsquo;d surf the Web for an hour, answer any emails he&rsquo;d received since he left work, and then try to get some sleep before the alarm went off again the next morning.</p>\n<p>When I met with Rick, he complained that he was becoming increasingly depressed. The first thing I asked him to do was describe his &ldquo;information-intake day,&rdquo; and after he did, in my best imitation of Dr. Phil McGraw, I asked him, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that working for you?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rick&rsquo;s problem was his mind diet. It wasn&rsquo;t thoughtful, and it didn&rsquo;t take his perspective into account. And that&rsquo;s ironic because Rick is a health nut. He doesn&rsquo;t eat refined sugars, red meat, processed foods, or non-organic fruit and vegetables.</p>\n<p>He scrutinizes menu for details about ingredients and presses servers for nutritional information about items he&rsquo;s considering. When it comes to mind food, however, he piles it on like rock candy and double cheeseburgers.</p>\n<p>When I shared with him the mind diet I&rsquo;m about to share with you, it led to radical change in Rick&rsquo;s attitude and level of confidence. When he realized that his mind &ldquo;ate&rdquo;, just as much as his body did, with good or bad results, he changed his information lifestyle, got some new friends, and took back his point of view.</p>\n<p>You should be as careful about what you put into your mind as about what you put into your mouth. Your mind is a machine. When you ingest a piece of information, your mind goes to work, chewing on it, digesting it, and then converting it into a thought.</p>\n<p>When good stuff goes into your mind, good thoughts emerge. People who maintain purposeful mind diets of positive stimuli think healthy thoughts. Moreover, if you don&rsquo;t give yourself some &lsquo;offline zones,&rsquo; technology will become your best friend - and that&rsquo;s not a balanced or healthy way to live.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which association you lead, the last few years have been jump-out- of-bed-and-hustle times for you. This is especially true in our great state, that battles with everything budget to the real estate bubble. Many of you will really relate to Rick&rsquo;s always on lifestyle - and wonder how you can break out of this treadmill.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s important that you do, because it will impact your ability to lead. Napoleon Bonaparte once said that &ldquo;the leader&rsquo;s role is to define reality, then give hope.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t do that if you fill your mind with either too much quantity or too little quality of information. To strike that reality/hope balance, you have to be able to master your mind, learn to absorb life&rsquo;s circumstances with a sense of confidence and empower yourself.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to take back a piece of your life, it starts with your morning. People often say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and they are right. But it&rsquo;s not just good for your body, it&rsquo;s critical for your mind as well. If you start out like Rick, the rest of the day will just wear on you, and you&rsquo;ll often fade before five.</p>\n<p>For years, I have focused my mornings on gathering strength and calm for the day. I do not go online for the first hour, my eyes are open - unless there is a must-do reason for it. Instead, when I first wake up, I spend five minutes doing a gratitude exercise, where I think of two people who helped me yesterday and one that will help me today. The first thing I do (after starting the coffee) is send a note to one of them or at least log it in a journal. That&rsquo;s a doing-exercise that paints me into a positive corner for the day. It also programs into my psyche that I am not alone in this world - that there is people who are following or assisting me towards the goal.</p>\n<p>I set aside about thirty minutes just to read from a good source: one that either inspires, informs or empowers me. Usually, books are my number one resource, because they offer the richest set of stories and data. I try and read at least one book every month, mostly in the mornings or when I travel.</p>\n<p>At the end of this morning program, I spend the last five minutes rehearsing my day to come with my daily calendar. I visualize the situations to come, the course with its obstacles, and my successful completion of everything I&rsquo;m going to do. When my schedule is especially packed, I call this exercise &ldquo;Working Out My Dance Moves.&rdquo; The more detail and hurdles you put into it, the more relaxed you&rsquo;ll be later that day when many of them pop up and you think - &ldquo;I was waiting for you!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When I do start my official work day, I also ease into it by focusing on a creative task to kick it off. I never just &lsquo;dive into my Inbox&rsquo; or deal with highly technical issues first thing. Over the course of the day, through my extra energy and focus, I find myself being much more productive than when I had a morning routine like Rick&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>So, please, try this at home. What&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen? An email waits in your Inbox one more hour? One of your managers will have to make a decision without you? You own your technology and information - don&rsquo;t let it own you. With all the new types of media coming out, and smart phones all but being installed on your hip, you need to be vigilant when it comes to your sanity.</p>",

      "description": "<p>We brought The Art of Leadership conference to San Diego and Chicago, and featured a line-up of thought leaders who touched on some of the most forward-thinking concepts facing leadership today. One of these thought leaders was Dr. Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of the New York Times bestseller Insight. Tasha has built a reputation as a fresh, modern voice in the business world by pairing her scientific grounding in human behaviour with a pragmatic approach to professional development. From our stage, she shared the following insights on how to increase our performance and self-awareness.</p>\n<p>Do you know or work with someone who is not self-aware? Tasha&rsquo;s research has identified &ldquo;74% of people work with at least three unaware co-workers.&rdquo; Tasha refers to self-awareness as &ldquo;the meta-skill of the 21st century&rdquo; and her research has identified self-aware leaders are:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><em>More successful at their jobs More promotable</em></li>\n <li><em>More respected leaders</em></li>\n <li><em>More confident and more effective communicators</em></li>\n <li><em>Better friends</em></li>\n <li><em>Likely to have happier marriages</em></li>\n <li><em>Likely to raise less narcissistic children</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As Tasha says, &ldquo;On a good day, 80% of us are lying to ourselves about lying to ourselves.&rdquo; In addition, Tasha suggests, &ldquo;The least competent people tend to be the most confident about their performance.&rdquo; Yikes.</p>\n<p>Tasha shared four tools we can all use to help gather feedback and introspect the right way.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Mindset Shift - We Must All Stop Assuming We Are Self-Aware</strong></p>\n<p>In her research, Tasha found that 95% of people believe they are self-aware, when in fact the percentage of people who were actually self aware was 10-15%. So how we do get to be more self aware? Knowing who you are internally and knowing how others see you is critical. Self-aware people:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><em>Know what they value</em></li>\n <li><em>Understand their passions</em></li>\n <li><em>Know what they aspire to and the experience they want to have</em></li>\n <li><em>Know the environments in which they fit</em></li>\n <li><em>Know their strengths and limitations</em></li>\n <li><em>Know their reactions</em></li>\n <li><em>Know the impact they have on others</em></li>\n <li><em>Are highly self-accepting</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Ask &ldquo;What&rdquo; Versus &ldquo;Why&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Great self-aware leaders also introspect the right way. Asking &lsquo;Why&rsquo; gets us stuck into what is wrong and it holds us back. Instead, by asking &lsquo;What&rsquo; we are able to look at possibilities to propel us forward. For example:</p>\n<p><em>Instead of asking &ldquo;Why do you want to change your job?&rdquo; ask &ldquo;What do you like about what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><strong>3. Ask the Magic Feedback Question</strong></p>\n<p>Self-aware leaders proactively seek feedback. To get an appreciation of how others see us, Tasha recommends we get some loving critics (who you know will give you honest, respectful feedback) to whom you can ask the magic feedback question:</p>\n<p><em>In the future, what can I do to be a better? (leader, coach, facilitator)</em></p>\n<p><strong>4. Think of a Business Process Review</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to build a self-aware team, implement a regular process that identifies the areas and processes that are working and not working. Awareness for everyone allows for success and to identify areas for improvement. Leaders who pave the way and provide the safety and expectation to tell the truth is a key element in creating self-aware teams.</p>\n<p>The journey to self-awareness happens incrementally through daily commitment to making small insights and discoveries about ourselves. Tasha encourages us all to ask ourselves: &lsquo;What am I going to do today so that I can transform my level of self-awareness and become a future- ready leader?</p>",

      "description": "<p>We sat down with six-time Olympic medalist Clara Hughes to learn how her experiences as one of Team Canada's most successful athletes translate into her current role as an advocate for positive mental health support in our ever-demanding society.</p>\n<p>Focusing on how adversity is a necessary component for leaders to navigate and fully appreciate success, Clara insightfully explains how the element of human connectivity is at the core of achieving mental wellness.</p>\n<p><strong>1. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us are dealing with mental health. What are the pitfalls that you feel can erode or even sabotage mental wellness in one&rsquo;s career?</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s so important to acknowledge the stress of these past two-plus years. No matter who you are, life has shifted dramatically. Everyone has experienced this time differently. It&rsquo;s crucial to acknowledge what this experience has been and continues to be. To go back to the concept of &lsquo;normal&rsquo; is unrealistic for most people. Failing to acknowledge the layers of stress and how work and everything our busy lives entail has changed will only exacerbate the load of pressure people feel. Finding ways to sit with the experience is important for not only reconciling but finding ways to move through what continues to be an incredibly challenging time in a more grounded way. Learning how to respond instead of reacting. Slowing things down to feel a more manageable place to once again step into work and life roles with a more grounded approach is crucial for survival. Remaining in the place of hyperstimulation is not sustainable for anyone. It takes time to make these small shifts in outlook and approach, but it&rsquo;s time well spent when it supports positive mental health.</p>\n<p><strong>2. You have been vocal about the importance of teachers/coaches who supported and believed in you throughout your career. How can an organization and its leaders best support a team member who is dealing with mental health?</strong></p>\n<p>An organization and its leaders can better support team members by creating and upholding a non-judgmental, professional space for everyone who might be dealing with a mental health concern. We all have mental health, and if you can create a workplace environment that breaks down the stigmas attached to mental illness and instead fosters the concept of positive mental health for all, you will create a space where people can feel supported. Providing opportunities for every level of the workforce to be educated on mental health and empowered with the potentially life-saving tools of mental health first aid and a trauma-informed foundation of understanding as to what these concerns could allow for people to know how to help when to help and most importantly how to help a person get assistance. What are the resources, and how can they be accessed? Where are these supports available? Workplaces that openly offer and provide support for employees when it comes to mental health can help bring a person to a place of wellness. To deny this is to deny the time we are in after such a massively difficult few years that has only elevated the stresses that can lead to a mental health crisis. The entire world has experienced this. It&rsquo;s proven that the earlier a person receives help the greater the chance of healing they have. Invest in the workplace to allow for this environment, and you will have a healthier, more productive place where everyone can thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What would you explain to both today&rsquo;s leaders and their team members about the value of human connection in the workplace?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a downside to this remarkable time we are in when it comes to technology and advances in the digital workspace. We are so hyper-connected that we are disconnected. We are literally glued to our phones in and out of our jobs. To create a place that is grounding, where people want to look up from the screen and get to know one another is to create a team that is rooted in human-to-human connection. We need to connect to know each other. To care about our work and our roles and the businesses we lead and represent. Providing opportunities for colleagues to connect in a more personal yet fully professional way can be a powerful foundation leading to jobs well done. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think there is a better place than in the natural world to do this. Every city has urban green spaces and a multitude of ways to connect to place, space, self and others. Be creative and bring your team back to the place of knowing each other and finding ways to work as a strong unit in this time of hyper connection. Use the wonderful and rich elements of creativity to bring people together. Nature, music, arts, and dance are but a few of the elements that can bridge the gaps and allow us to connect again as people.</p>\n<p><strong>4. As an Olympic athlete, you had to reach deep to find the strength to persevere even when the task at hand seemed insurmountable. Where do you feel today&rsquo;s women in leadership roles can draw similar strengths?</strong></p>\n<p>Knowing that each victory you have sets the tone for the women and girls who will follow your lead is a huge motivator to me. We all have this opportunity. There is still so much ground to be covered in terms of gender equality and cultural representation so that all people can see themselves in the places and spaces of success so that every young person can not only dream of becoming something but see clearly it is possible. The more visible we are in roles of leadership and mentorship, the stronger we all are. I once learned from a great teacher that you cannot want greatness for yourself until you want it for everyone around you. This rings true for women in the workforce, in community, family and in life.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Why does success require an element of struggle? How can we channel our adversity (both internal and external) into an ambition to succeed?</strong></p>\n<p>The human condition spans the spectrum of struggle to joy. There is no way to have only one and not the other. You could think success and joy are synonymous, but I&rsquo;ve met so many people who are truly miserable in their success. It&rsquo;s a powerful, grounded place to be when you can embrace struggle and use it as fuel to light your dreams on fire and keep the flames alive. My greatest moments are when I can make mistakes, when I can &lsquo;fail&rsquo; along the way to what I know I can do, and I can laugh at myself. I can disarm the pressure of feeling I have to be good all the time at everything. There is, however, a balance to be had. There cannot be too much struggle because it will overwhelm the capacity to laugh and learn. Which is why it&rsquo;s important to create opportunities that are personal and often private elements to maintain this fine balance. Taking and making the time for mindfulness and connection is key to keeping this balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6. How has the idea of success/excellence shifted throughout your career? What advice would you give today&rsquo;s aspiring leaders who are striving toward the concept of &ldquo;success&rdquo;?</strong></p>\n<p>My idea of success changed dramatically during my 23 years in sport. It continues to change. I value more and more the places and spaces in between the big moments I&rsquo;ve experienced. The quiet time of grounding into who I am outside of my success has allowed for an even greater sense of achievement that builds an energy inside that people connect to. So it&rsquo;s more about what I give to others in my success than what I have for myself that matters to me. Realizing this was a hard set of lessons. When you win that big thing and realize it&rsquo;s just more stuff, it can be crushing. The greatest lesson for me was learning that nothing I have will make me happy unless I have that connection to who I am without these medals or achievements. This is the place where I am grounded and can project the good and encouraging energy of hope and possibilities to others.</p>\n<p><strong>7. How can leaders demonstrate both an &lsquo;open heart&rsquo; and an &lsquo;open mind&rsquo; in today&rsquo;s workplace?</strong></p>\n<p>Leadership can be an exhausting, lonely place to be. I go back to that place of wanting others to be good and successful. Realizing that the people I get to work with, to mentor and encourage, are also a phenomenal source of energy for me in a leadership or teaching role. It&rsquo;s almost like a portal into the mind of the beginner that opens you up to learning no matter who you are and what you&rsquo;ve achieved. Find these inspiring people around you and know we all have more to experience, to achieve and to share. To learn! When you think you know everything you are really stuck, and that&rsquo;s a lonely place to be.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p>A new kind of employee is redefining the workplace globally. Known as \"Millennials,\" these young workers - born between 1980 and 2004 - are the most educated and tech-savvy generation in history and they have significantly different expectations of work than their predecessors. At the same time, \"Boomers,\" those born between 1943 and 1960, are starting to retire, and a race to replace them with top talent has begun. It's predicted that by 2020, Millennials will make up 50% of the workforce globally, so having a plan to attract and retain the best and brightest is critical to your business' long-term success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So what do you need to know about \"Millennials\" in order to drive your business into the future?</p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Advantage Through Your People</strong></p>\n<p>As the massive Boomer generation exits the workforce, your competitive advantage will become even more tied to the ability to understand and capitalize on what motivates your people and make that work for your business. Millennials are less afraid of failute and driven less by financial incentives, so if your aren't able to meet their needs, they'll find an employer that will. This, coupled with the challenges of implementing successful succession plans for retiring senior leaders, will significantly impact your business' strategy for growth. And, if you aren't planning for this now, you'll most likely be left behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Engaging and Retaining Millennials</strong></p>\n<p>So how do you develop and retain the best people who will move your business forward? The solution isn't as complex or as expensive as you may think. Millennials put high value on learning and development opportunities, being thanked and appreciated for their efforts and being provided with flexibility in terms of how and when they work. Implementing flexible work hours, for example, is a way to drive productivity, at next to no cost. But this type of culture change within an organization, while free, can be tough for Boomers and Gen Xers to adopt. These generations have relied on a more traditional way of operating. They're typically accustomed to working t their desks in an office, and have the understanding that no feedback from a superior must mean good feedback - a stark contrast to how today's younger workers operate. So for a culture change of this magnitude to be successful, it needs to start with the right tone from the top. Leadership can implement programs where people are rewarded for demonstrating the behaviours the company values, like saying thank you and working collaboratively. Aligning the desired culture change to your company programs, like rewards and flexbility, and overall business strategy is critical to appeal to and retain top talent not just for Millennials but across the generations.</p>\n<p><em>People risk is a key part of your enterprise risk management strategy.</em></p>\n<p>Keeping your people engages by demonstrating that you understand their needs, and then aligning those needs to your business strategy, is a sign of a high performing company. It's also been found that multi-generational working groups are the most innovative, and when properly engages, these teams will help set your business apart.</p>\n<p><em>How are the leaders of your organization aligning strategies and adapting to the changing risk management strategy?</em></p>\n<p>If they aren't doing anything, consider the risks and impact on your reputation and bottom line. Your people risk needs to be a component of your Enterprise Risk Management strategy, or your productivity and ability to meet your strategic objectives will be compromised. These are our top 10 questions leaders should be talking about in managing a multi-generational workforce to get conversation started.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Characteristics of the Multi-Generational Workforce</strong></p>\n<p>Do we understand the different values and motivations in our multi-generational workforce?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By looking at what drives people engagement, you can clearly see differences in what each generation calues and what they look for in an employer. While your Boomer sought good paying jobs, recognition and status, your Millennials want to be part of a diverse team, learn new things every day, have more flexibility to manage their lives and interact with people through social media. Identifying these differences and addressing them proactively will help you retain top talent.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Recruitment</strong></p>\n<p>How are we making sure we're finding top talent?</p>\n<p>If you're not connected daily to potential recruits through social media then you're missing out on some of the top talent. Your recruiters should be using social media sites as key sources for finding non-active job seekers. Not only will these potential recruits learn about your organization, you'll learn a lot about them from their social media profile. To assess talent, focus on the candidate profile your organization needs for the future, which is moving much more towards leadership capabilities and less on technical skills. Qualities like being able to adapt to change, understanding and supporting a team and being flexible are increasingly important in a multi-generational workforce. Recruitment techniques need to move beyong the traditional interview into assessment centres, profiling and other methods to help get a fuller picture of the capabilities of the people you are hiring.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Retention</strong></p>\n<p>What kind of work environment and practices do we have in place to drive retention?</p>\n<p>For the Millennial generation, they need to feel emotionally connected to their place of work to be engages and to stay. Retention, for this generation, is founded on four key drivers: a flexible work environment, engaging work and development opportunities, a sense of community and competitive pay. Are you supporting these drivers by ensuring your organization promotes flexibility, leanring opportunities, the ability to give back to the community and by offering competitive compensation?</p>\n<p><strong>4. Balance and Workload</strong></p>\n<p>Excessive and prolonged work hours has been found to predict higher turnover, lower commitment and reduced job satisfaction. How are we addressing this imbalance?</p>\n<p>Work/life imbalance has a negative impact on people's commitment to their work and may even influence their choice to leave a job, and this is even more pronounced with top performers and Millennials. Looking at different ways to manage your workforce through, for example, offering flexible work hours, flexible time off programs and supplementing your workforce during peak periods with contingent workers, are a few ways to address this issue to mitigate the risk of losing your top talent.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Leadership Development</strong></p>\n<p>As a Baby Boomer of Gen X, what are some of the things I need to learn or change to manage Millennials?</p>\n<p>Millennials don't expect their employers to manage their career or provide them with job security, but they do expect learning and development opportunities, engaging work and flexibility in how they work. Leaders will need to adapt to this style of working. Learning about what this generation needs from you, and monitoring how well you're doing is how you can demonstrate to your Millennials that you value them and want them to stay.</p>\n<p><strong>6. People and Teams</strong></p>\n<p>Do I have the right people with the right skills in place to manage more flexibility in the workplace?</p>\n<p>Just as talent needs are shifting, so too is the way business is conducted. Flexibility is important to all generations, but is critical for Millennials. We are seeing the rise of more and more virtual teams which present unique challenges for management in terms of providing leadership, coaching and general oversight to a team that you don;t see, and who don't see each other in the workplace every day. What technology do you have in place to make work more efficient, productive and flexible and do your leaders trust their staff to be productive in a virtual workplace?</p>\n<p><strong>7. Cultural Change</strong></p>\n<p>How are we addressing the cultural change that needs to take place to support a multigenerational workforce?</p>\n<p>Having leaders who are comfortable working within a flexible work environment and who are supportive of a flexible culture is critical. This is a challenge for leaders who didn't grow up in that type of flexible environment. Equally, the need to give continual recognition and appreciation for a job well done is very important to the Millennial generation. Think of it as 'instantaneous feedback'. For many leaders who were occasionally told they were doing a good job, this is another big change to realize that Millennials need more regular feedback and appreciation for their efforts. Remember, for Millennials, flexibility and appreciation are major drivers of commitment, so your corporate culture will need to adapt to reflect this trend.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Learning and Development</strong></p>\n<p>What kinds of learning and development solutions do we have in place to support our people's development?</p>\n<p>Millennials expect skill development in return for delivering high quality work. They want to be continually learning and improving their skill sets. We continue to see a trend towards the gamification of learning solutions to adapt to this generation's needs. It's a different approach to learning and one many organizations are adapting. To engage your workforce, what solutions do you have in place for developing your people on an ongoing basis? Take into consideration all of your options -- secondments to other offices or groups, formal and informal mentoring and other experiential learning opportunities, like job shadowing to help meet this growing need from your teams.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Compensation</strong></p>\n<p>Are there differences in how each generation perceives compensation?</p>\n<p>How people perveive their pay plays a key role in retention and job satisfaction. Millennials aren't as concerned with pay (providing the pay is competitive) and choose to stay with an organization for other reasons. Giving your Millennials more control over their career path, development opportunities and work/life flexibility are things to keep in mind to retain them.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Planning for the Future</strong></p>\n<p>Why's understanding the multi-generational workforce so important for leaders today?</p>\n<p>In a relatively healthy Canadian job market, top performing Millennials can and may go elsewhere - either for an environment that tey perceive will help them grow professionally or improved work/life flexibility. Due to improvements in technology and increased mobility, competition for the top talent continues to be a challenge. If you don't stay vigilant and continue to find ways to adapt to and support your changing workforce needs, you risk losing your best and brightest.</p>",

          "textOnly": "<p>A new kind of employee is redefining the workplace globally. Known as \"Millennials,\" these young workers - born between 1980 and 2004 - are the most educated and tech-savvy generation in history and they have significantly different expectations of work than their predecessors. At the same time, \"Boomers,\" those born between 1943 and 1960, are starting to retire, and a race to replace them with top talent has begun. It's predicted that by 2020, Millennials will make up 50% of the workforce globally, so having a plan to attract and retain the best and brightest is critical to your business' long-term success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So what do you need to know about \"Millennials\" in order to drive your business into the future?</p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Advantage Through Your People</strong></p>\n<p>As the massive Boomer generation exits the workforce, your competitive advantage will become even more tied to the ability to understand and capitalize on what motivates your people and make that work for your business. Millennials are less afraid of failute and driven less by financial incentives, so if your aren't able to meet their needs, they'll find an employer that will. This, coupled with the challenges of implementing successful succession plans for retiring senior leaders, will significantly impact your business' strategy for growth. And, if you aren't planning for this now, you'll most likely be left behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Engaging and Retaining Millennials</strong></p>\n<p>So how do you develop and retain the best people who will move your business forward? The solution isn't as complex or as expensive as you may think. Millennials put high value on learning and development opportunities, being thanked and appreciated for their efforts and being provided with flexibility in terms of how and when they work. Implementing flexible work hours, for example, is a way to drive productivity, at next to no cost. But this type of culture change within an organization, while free, can be tough for Boomers and Gen Xers to adopt. These generations have relied on a more traditional way of operating. They're typically accustomed to working t their desks in an office, and have the understanding that no feedback from a superior must mean good feedback - a stark contrast to how today's younger workers operate. So for a culture change of this magnitude to be successful, it needs to start with the right tone from the top. Leadership can implement programs where people are rewarded for demonstrating the behaviours the company values, like saying thank you and working collaboratively. Aligning the desired culture change to your company programs, like rewards and flexbility, and overall business strategy is critical to appeal to and retain top talent not just for Millennials but across the generations.</p>\n<p><em>People risk is a key part of your enterprise risk management strategy.</em></p>\n<p>Keeping your people engages by demonstrating that you understand their needs, and then aligning those needs to your business strategy, is a sign of a high performing company. It's also been found that multi-generational working groups are the most innovative, and when properly engages, these teams will help set your business apart.</p>\n<p><em>How are the leaders of your organization aligning strategies and adapting to the changing risk management strategy?</em></p>\n<p>If they aren't doing anything, consider the risks and impact on your reputation and bottom line. Your people risk needs to be a component of your Enterprise Risk Management strategy, or your productivity and ability to meet your strategic objectives will be compromised. These are our top 10 questions leaders should be talking about in managing a multi-generational workforce to get conversation started.</p>\n<p><strong>1.

Why is it so damn hard to get other people to understand who we are and where we&rsquo;re coming from?</p>\n<p>The answer lies, in large part, in a simple fact: The human brain is the Ebeneezer Scrooge of organs. It sits on reserves of mental energy and processing capacity, like Scrooge sat on his mountain of money, unwilling to spend much of it unless it really has to. To keep from having to work too hard, the brain relies on simple, efficient thought processes to get the job done &ndash; not so much out of laziness (though there is some of that, too), but out of necessity. There is just too much going on, too much to notice, understand, and act on for the brain to give every individual and every occurrence its undivided, unbiased attention.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to perceiving you, your colleagues are (without realizing it) relying heavily on assumptions &ndash; the miserly brain&rsquo;s favorite shortcut. They guide what the perceiver sees, how that information is interpreted, and how it is remembered &ndash; forming an integral part of his or her perception of you.</p>\n<p>Assumptions come in many varieties. Two of the most powerful and pervasive of these are confirmation bias and the primacy effect.</p>\n<p><strong>CONFIRMATION BIAS</strong></p>\n<p>When other people look at you, they see what they expect to see. If they have reason to believe that you are smart, they will see evidence of intelligence in your behavior - whether or not there is any. If they have reason to believe you are dishonest, they will interpret a lack of eye contact or awkward body language as evidence that you have something to hide &ndash; as opposed to evidence that you are shy, or distracted, or in gastric distress.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, people will interpret your current behavior in a way that makes it consistent with your past behavior &ndash; and they will tend to play down or completely ignore evidence that contradicts their existing option of you. And they will have no idea that they are doing it.</p>\n<p>Confirmation bias is shaped by many factors. Stereotypes about the groups to which you belong, your apparent similarity to other people the perceiver knows, and culture (yours and theirs), are among the most consequential. And of course, their own past experience with you, if they have any, plays a major role.</p>\n<p>That last part seems fairly logical, as far as assumptions go. If you have been gregarious, or pessimistic, or hotheaded in the past, it&rsquo;s reasonable to think you are likely to continue to be so in the future, and to interpret your behavior accordingly. If you say something that could be considered offensive or humorous, and I know you to be a jokester, then I&rsquo;m more likely to go with the latter interpretation and to see the humor in your off-color remark. My past experience with you helps me to make the right call.</p>\n<p>The problem, however, is that our early impressions of a person can hold far too much weight, and can lead us astray when they paint an inaccurate picture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>THE PRIMACY EFFECT</strong></p>\n<p>First impressions matter most. In other words, information we get about a person early in our observation of them influences how we interpret and remember everything that comes after.</p>\n<p>Imagine two children &ndash; each taking a thirty-question math test. On the first half, Timmy gets fourteen out of fifteen correct, while John gets only six. In the second half, the scores reverse &ndash; with John getting fourteen, and Timmy only six. Objectively, these two children have both performed at exactly the same level &ndash; getting a total of twenty out of thirty problems correct. So rationally, anyone watching would conclude that they have the same level of mastery in math, right?</p>\n<p>Only that&rsquo;s not what happens &ndash; not even close. In study after study, researchers find that Timmy is perceived &ndash; even by experts, like math teachers &ndash; to be the more talented of the two. This is because performance on the first half of the test exerts a far greater influence on judgment than performance on the second. In essence, when the test is only halfway finished, the perceiver has already concluded that Timmy is smart and John is not. What happens afterward does precious little to alter those initial impressions.</p>\n<p>The implications of findings like these for &ldquo;late bloomers,&rdquo; or anyone who struggles initially only to excel later, are terrifying. It&rsquo;s not impossible to change these initial impressions, but it really tough. John would have to present overwhelming evidence of his math ability in order to&nbsp;override it, while Timmy can happily coast on his early success for quite a while. The problem for John is that he may not even be given the chance to override that impression, if he is placed in a remedial math track, or discouraged from pursuing math altogether.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the primacy effect is also the reason why your parents still treat you like you are twelve even when&nbsp;you are forty. In their eyes, you are still the person they first knew you to be &ndash; naive, inexperienced, and more than a little foolish. My mother still insists that I am disorganized and scatterbrained, despite the fact that I literally make my living writing and speaking about planning and time management. She constantly tells me that I should &ldquo;learn to write things down.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So now that you know about the confirmation bias and primacy effect, what should you do?</p>\n<p>For starters, try really hard to make an accurate first impression. Often, this means making your thoughts and intentions more clear &ndash; don&rsquo;t leave people to make &ldquo;guesses&rdquo; about what you are like or what you want, because they may guess wrong, and then you&rsquo;ll have a very steep hill to climb to undo the damage that&rsquo;s been done.</p>\n<p>Second, recognize that confirmation bias is a formidable foe. To get someone else to not simply see what they expect to see, you&rsquo;re going to need to go out of way to do something attention-getting. If your boss thinks you are a procrastinator, turning a few things in on time won&rsquo;t help you. Turn in everything early for about a month or two, at least, and you&rsquo;ll be on the right track. Evidence has to be hard to ignore to get past the confirmation bias. After all, it took three ghostly visitations to get Scrooge to part with his pennies &ndash; so think big. (But not quite so scary.)</p>",

      "description": "<p>Openness to new opportunities, however unpredictable or unexpected, has been a major element of my success. When people, usually women, ask about my professional achievements, I can honestly say they have had more to do with taking chances than setting a career goal. I never set out to navigate a route to the top tier of any organization or corporation. To me, the most exciting career paths are those that unfold in unexpected ways. I am anti five-year plan because in my experience the best things do not flow from making a plan and sticking to it. The key is to believe that you have what it takes not only to meet the challenges you find along the way, but to be open to what you learn on that journey. If you lock yourself into a single dream job you&rsquo;re desperate to attain, you may close yourself off from something even grander.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a growing recognition that following one&rsquo;s dreams or passions is no guarantee of success or happiness. Author Cal Newport, a computer scientist at Georgetown University, calls it the &ldquo;passion trap&rdquo; and suggests that passion may in fact be the root of widespread workplace unhappiness. In his recent book, So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You, Newport argues that if people only seek out work they love, they are bound to become disillusioned when they fail to love the work they do and essentially find their dreams unfulfilled. The passion trap prevents people from pursuing opportunities that don&rsquo;t match their preconceived dreams.</p>\n<p>As technology rapidly reshapes the global economy, relying on your dreams to guide your worklife could hold you back from what can make you truly happy. Traditional industries are being transformed (or failing) and traditional jobs are morphing and vanishing too. Today&rsquo;s list of dream jobs simply doesn&rsquo;t include the many possibilities for work that tomorrow is bound to bring. The US Department of Education, for instance, estimates that 60 percent of all new jobs created over the next two decades will&nbsp;require skills that only 20 percent of the current workforce possesses. The smart approach may be to unhook your ambitions from a particular plan because those plans are informed by the world of today where, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for many traditional vocations is rapidly shrinking. For example, metal and plastic machine workers are increasingly not needed as manufacturing becomes more automated; so, too, mainstream journalists, whose numbers are diminishing along with traditional print outlets; travel agents who find it hard to compete with DIY travel sites; postal workers, as people write fewer letters; and so on. At the same time, new occupations are emerging in the knowledge economy that no one ever dreamed of at those old-school career fairs, jobs like directors of community engagement, brand strategists, chief experience officers. What&rsquo;s hopeful about this from a gender perspective is that none of these titles have a traditional gender. Say &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo; &ldquo;lawyer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxman&rdquo; and people still tend to picture, well, a man. But if you think &ldquo;industrialorganizational psychologist,&rdquo; &ldquo;genetic counsellor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;information security analyst&rdquo;&mdash;all occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts will grow robustly over the next decade&mdash; likely no gender comes to mind. Which is why today, for women, and men, too, keeping your mind open to the widest range of opportunities will reduce the chances you&rsquo;ll find yourself boxed in.</p>\n<p>In my own case, when I arrived at Paragon Entertainment all those years ago, my unfamiliarity with the television industry was an asset. It prompted me to learn as much as I could. And as receptionist/girl Friday I got to see and hear it all. I was a blank slate, with the desire and curiosity not only to learn the business, but also to bring to it fresh ideas precisely because I was new. And in Isme Bennie, I found the perfect boss for an eager proteg&eacute;e, one who recognized my energy and encouraged my opinions. She threw me into challenges all on my own and also included me in on the high-level&nbsp;business deals she was negotiating. One thing we soon did together was look at shows that we might want to add to the roster we were selling to broadcasters worldwide, from Channel 9 Australia to HBO Ole.</p>\n<p>One of the first shows I lobbied for reflected the kind of outside-the-box thinking a newbie can bring. Unlike the dramas and cartoon series that Paragon was known for, I thought the time was right to pick up a bare-bones how-to decorating show from a complete unknown. Her name was Debbie Travis, a former UK fashion model who had worked in TV editing and production. After moving to Montreal to be with her new husband, Hans Rosenstein, a video distributor who&rsquo;d worked with Paragon, Debbie had time on her hands and she decided to paint and redecorate their old Victorian house. She did it with such style that clients came calling, so many that she and Hans produced an instructional video with Debbie demonstrating her crafty techniques in a show they called The Painted House.</p>\n<p>I loved the idea instantly, and Isme agreed. Decorating shows like Trading Spaces and Changing Rooms had recently debuted in the UK and the US, and I had a strong sense that lifestylemakeover programming was about to take off. Most home improvement programs until then had been of the This Old House variety, where someone with deep pockets took whole properties down to the studs and renovated them top to bottom. But The Painted House didn&rsquo;t feature historic mansions, just rooms&mdash;a makeover of a bathroom, a kitchen, a bedroom. All you need is &ldquo;a little bit of paint&rdquo; was Debbie&rsquo;s motto. It empowered people. She was selftaught and presented fantastically. With her model looks and Lancashire accent intact from her hometown in England&rsquo;s northwest, she sounded like she&rsquo;d walked off the set of Coronation Street. As it turned out, The Painted House exceeded all expectations, in Canada and beyond. With infinite possibilities for time slots in the expanding cable universe, in primetime or daytime, it became a worldwide hit. It also proved to me that while I had no talent in front of the camera, I could spot it from behind.</p>\n<p>You could call it a sixth sense or intuition. I think of it as an aptitude for stepping outside of myself, and the moment, to ask not whether I personally like something, but whether others will like it&mdash;metaphorically becoming part of the crowd and sensing what turns them on. I am not a fan of Monster Trucks, or an avid watcher of figure-skating specials, but I have represented both enthusiastically because I appreciate their appeal to others. I think this ability to have a bead on broad public tastes has always been with me. I love being able to spot &ldquo;it&rdquo;&mdash;that quality that makes someone or something shine above the rest. And I feel immense satisfaction when I get it right. Even as a kid, I used to listen to new releases from Madonna or early Duran Duran and be able to predict which song would be a hit. A few bars in, I could just tell. I dreamt about one day becoming a music industry executive, plucking potential stars out of the crowd. I dropped that dream in the midst of university applications and career- planning classes. But as fate would have it, I landed in a completely different career that allowed me to pick out the &ldquo;it&rdquo; and help make it shine.</p>",

          "textOnly": "<p>Openness to new opportunities, however unpredictable or unexpected, has been a major element of my success. When people, usually women, ask about my professional achievements, I can honestly say they have had more to do with taking chances than setting a career goal. I never set out to navigate a route to the top tier of any organization or corporation. To me, the most exciting career paths are those that unfold in unexpected ways. I am anti five-year plan because in my experience the best things do not flow from making a plan and sticking to it. The key is to believe that you have what it takes not only to meet the challenges you find along the way, but to be open to what you learn on that journey. If you lock yourself into a single dream job you&rsquo;re desperate to attain, you may close yourself off from something even grander.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a growing recognition that following one&rsquo;s dreams or passions is no guarantee of success or happiness. Author Cal Newport, a computer scientist at Georgetown University, calls it the &ldquo;passion trap&rdquo; and suggests that passion may in fact be the root of widespread workplace unhappiness. In his recent book, So Good They Can&rsquo;t Ignore You, Newport argues that if people only seek out work they love, they are bound to become disillusioned when they fail to love the work they do and essentially find their dreams unfulfilled. The passion trap prevents people from pursuing opportunities that don&rsquo;t match their preconceived dreams.</p>\n<p>As technology rapidly reshapes the global economy, relying on your dreams to guide your worklife could hold you back from what can make you truly happy. Traditional industries are being transformed (or failing) and traditional jobs are morphing and vanishing too. Today&rsquo;s list of dream jobs simply doesn&rsquo;t include the many possibilities for work that tomorrow is bound to bring. The US Department of Education, for instance, estimates that 60 percent of all new jobs created over the next two decades will&nbsp;require skills that only 20 percent of the current workforce possesses. The smart approach may be to unhook your ambitions from a particular plan because those plans are informed by the world of today where, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for many traditional vocations is rapidly shrinking. For example, metal and plastic machine workers are increasingly not needed as manufacturing becomes more automated; so, too, mainstream journalists, whose numbers are diminishing along with traditional print outlets; travel agents who find it hard to compete with DIY travel sites; postal workers, as people write fewer letters; and so on. At the same time, new occupations are emerging in the knowledge economy that no one ever dreamed of at those old-school career fairs, jobs like directors of community engagement, brand strategists, chief experience officers. What&rsquo;s hopeful about this from a gender perspective is that none of these titles have a traditional gender. Say &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo; &ldquo;lawyer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxman&rdquo; and people still tend to picture, well, a man. But if you think &ldquo;industrialorganizational psychologist,&rdquo; &ldquo;genetic counsellor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;information security analyst&rdquo;&mdash;all occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts will grow robustly over the next decade&mdash; likely no gender comes to mind. Which is why today, for women, and men, too, keeping your mind open to the widest range of opportunities will reduce the chances you&rsquo;ll find yourself boxed in.</p>\n<p>In my own case, when I arrived at Paragon Entertainment all those years ago, my unfamiliarity with the television industry was an asset. It prompted me to learn as much as I could. And as receptionist/girl Friday I got to see and hear it all. I was a blank slate, with the desire and curiosity not only to learn the business, but also to bring to it fresh ideas precisely because I was new. And in Isme Bennie, I found the perfect boss for an eager proteg&eacute;e, one who recognized my energy and encouraged my opinions. She threw me into challenges all on my own and also included me in on the high-level&nbsp;business deals she was negotiating. One thing we soon did together was look at shows that we might want to add to the roster we were selling to broadcasters worldwide, from Channel 9 Australia to HBO Ole.</p>\n<p>One of the first shows I lobbied for reflected the kind of outside-the-box thinking a newbie can bring. Unlike the dramas and cartoon series that Paragon was known for, I thought the time was right to pick up a bare-bones how-to decorating show from a complete unknown. Her name was Debbie Travis, a former UK fashion model who had worked in TV editing and production. After moving to Montreal to be with her new husband, Hans Rosenstein, a video distributor who&rsquo;d worked with Paragon, Debbie had time on her hands and she decided to paint and redecorate their old Victorian house. She did it with such style that clients came calling, so many that she and Hans produced an instructional video with Debbie demonstrating her crafty techniques in a show they called The Painted House.</p>\n<p>I loved the idea instantly, and Isme agreed. Decorating shows like Trading Spaces and Changing Rooms had recently debuted in the UK and the US, and I had a strong sense that lifestylemakeover programming was about to take off. Most home improvement programs until then had been of the This Old House variety, where someone with deep pockets took whole properties down to the studs and renovated them top to bottom. But The Painted House didn&rsquo;t feature historic mansions, just rooms&mdash;a makeover of a bathroom, a kitchen, a bedroom. All you need is &ldquo;a little bit of paint&rdquo; was Debbie&rsquo;s motto. It empowered people. She was selftaught and presented fantastically. With her model looks and Lancashire accent intact from her hometown in England&rsquo;s northwest, she sounded like she&rsquo;d walked off the set of Coronation Street. As it turned out, The Painted House exceeded all expectations, in Canada and beyond. With infinite possibilities for time slots in the expanding cable universe, in primetime or daytime, it became a worldwide hit. It also proved to me that while I had no talent in front of the camera, I could spot it from behind.</p>\n<p>You could call it a sixth sense or intuition. I think of it as an aptitude for stepping outside of myself, and the moment, to ask not whether I personally like something, but whether others will like it&mdash;metaphorically becoming part of the crowd and sensing what turns them on. I am not a fan of Monster Trucks, or an avid watcher of figure-skating specials, but I have represented both enthusiastically because I appreciate their appeal to others. I think this ability to have a bead on broad public tastes has always been with me. I love being able to spot &ldquo;it&rdquo;&mdash;that quality that makes someone or something shine above the rest. And I feel immense satisfaction when I get it right. Even as a kid, I used to listen to new releases from Madonna or early Duran Duran and be able to predict which song would be a hit. A few bars in, I could just tell. I dreamt about one day becoming a music industry executive, plucking potential stars out of the crowd. I dropped that dream in the midst of university applications and career- planning classes. But as fate would have it, I landed in a completely different career that allowed me to pick out the &ldquo;it&rdquo; and help make it shine.</p>"

      "description": "<p>From the growing number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) to the expansion of data analytics, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), the impact of technology is rapidly increasing. The speed and scope of the changes associated with this technological revolution are like none we&rsquo;ve seen before, reshaping work and home environments and how we interact as a people and a society.</p>\n<p>Today&rsquo;s business and local government leaders are facing a tremendous challenge: the need to navigate the digital era amid a growing gap in the skills required to harness new technologies. To address this challenge, businesses will need to invest in upskilling their workforce.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to guide your organization through the challenges ahead?</p>\n<p><strong>THE WIDENING SKILLS GAP</strong></p>\n<p>According to our annual CEO Survey, 88% of Canadian CEOs are concerned about the availability of important skills in their industry, up from 51% in 2018. Global CEOs expressed a similar concern, placing the availability of key skills as the third top threat to growth, up from No. 5 last year. But unlike their global counterparts, Canadian CEOs are less likely to prioritize upskilling. Just 16% of Canadian CEOs cited significant upskilling as the most important solution to addressing a skills gap, versus 46% of their global counterparts. Instead, they cited strong educational pipelines as their preferred (41%) solution.</p>\n<p>The growing skills gap represents a very real issue that stands to hold back organizational performance and prosperity. Adding to the challenge is the concern about job displacement associated with technological advancement as automation threatens many existing jobs. Hundreds of millions of young people around the world are coming of age and finding themselves unemployed and unemployable, while many older, long-established employees are discovering their jobs are becoming obsolete.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, jobs requiring knowledge of AI, robotics, and IoT are going unfilled in ever-greater numbers.</p>\n<p>Together, these trends have broadened the gap between the employees of the present and the workforce of the future. Unless we find a solution, the social impact of job loss&mdash;for individuals, the organizations that employ them and the communities around them&mdash;will be even more staggering than it has been in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>UPSKILLING DEFINED</strong></p>\n<p>Upskilling refers to the expansion of people&rsquo;s capabilities and employability to fulfill the talent needs of a rapidly changing economy. An upskilling initiative can take place at the level of a company, an industry, or a community.</p>\n<p>Upskilling shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with reskilling, a term associated with short-term efforts undertaken for specific groups. By contrast, upskilling is a comprehensive initiative to convert applicable knowledge into productive results. It involves identifying the skills that will be most valuable in the future, the businesses that will need them, the people who need work and could plausibly gain those skills and the training and technology-enabled learning that could help them.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a one-time endeavor, and it involves every member of the workforce. From the front lines to the C-suite, the goal of upskilling is to have all members continually expand or augment their skills. Those skills aren&rsquo;t limited to the realm of technology. They also include soft skills like the ability to learn and grasp new knowledge, improving communication, fostering teamwork and developing leadership. This way, employees can adapt to fit the roles needed for tomorrow that we can&rsquo;t forecast today.</p>\n<p>Some of the most effective upskilling initiatives take place at a community level, where government, business and not-for-profit organizations work together, often in new ways.</p>\n<p><strong>COST CONCERNS</strong></p>\n<p>At first glance, the costs of upskilling appear daunting. But they should be considered in the context of the alternatives: severance costs for laid-off workers, plus the time and expense involved in finding, recruiting and on-boarding new people with the skills most in demand. Moreover, an upskilling program doesn&rsquo;t need to upgrade skills for the entire workforce at once. In any given year, only 10 percent of a company&rsquo;s workforce is immediately at risk.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, skills mismatches have a direct impact on a country&rsquo;s GDP, tax revenues and social safety net bill. Analysis of the return on investment for existing cases suggests that $1 invested in upskilling tends to return at least $2 in revenues or savings.</p>\n<p><strong>ROAD MAP FOR AN UPSKILLING INITIATIVE</strong></p>\n<p>Our society&rsquo;s intellectual capital may well depend on deepening our understanding of how to effectively design and implement upskilling initiatives. Below are six key action steps:<br />\n<br />\n<em>1. Analyze the situation and define the initiative:</em></p>\n<p>Some upskilling efforts may begin as regional initiatives, driven by government leaders; others might start within a single enterprise. All will have some elements in common:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>a commitment to lifelong learning rather than the preservation of specific jobs;</li>\n <li>support for individuals undergoing change; and</li>\n <li>a reasonable time horizon, generally nine to 18 months, for the first round of activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Begin by convening candid dialogues with key stakeholders. The initiative must coordinate decisions and actions on several levels at once. To keep these activities aligned, a core group of sponsors and a project leadership team must manage the initiative and organize communications. There&rsquo;s also generally a technological component developing digitally enabled methods for gathering data, assessing skills and facilitating lifelong learning.</p>\n<p>Set quantitative objectives indicating the desired return for each stakeholder group (for example, the government, the company and the individual). It&rsquo;s also important to set non-numeric objectives, which articulate the positive future state and motivate people.<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. Design a skills plan:</em></p>\n<p>Base your priorities on the types of jobs that will be affected most by new technologies, the employees who are most at risk and the businesses that have the most to gain.</p>\n<p>Off-the-shelf analytic workforce planning tools can help you estimate the impact of new technologies on companies, the savings that automation will generate, the types of new skills that will be needed and the number of months or years it will take for these changes to happen.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. Assess and advise individual employees:</em></p>\n<p>Some form of individual transformation will take place for participants, sometimes taking them out of their comfort zones. A considered assessment program that includes personal coaching and advice can go a long way toward relieving employees&rsquo; fears.</p>\n<p>For each participant, create an individual skills development plan, defining the steps and training necessary to address the new job requirements or even make broader changes. Ideally, individual workers should feel they&rsquo;re in charge of their own process.<br />\n<br />\n<em>4. Match jobs and engage workers:</em></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s rare to find the perfect match right away; make use of IT systems that quantify the skills gap between the candidate and job requirements.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to ensure positive communication with supervisors, transparency about the project and its implications for employees, encouragement to ask for help when needed, strong support for workers&rsquo; upskilling decisions and standardized rules for all HR advisors.<br />\n<br />\n<em>5. Select training and providers:</em></p>\n<p>The quality, value and efficiency of the training experience affect every aspect of the upskilling initiative, from its costs to employee outlook and motivation. In selecting professional programs, your key criteria are market recognition, track record and the trust built in the past through placing graduates in new jobs.<br />\n<br />\n<em>6. Administer the project and monitor results:</em></p>\n<p>Upskilling is challenging for everyone involved. Bring together the HR departments of relevant companies as administrators, and use digital HR tools to keep track of activity and results.</p>\n<p>Set up a communications plan, publishing success stories and communicating the benefits to the broader community and to the media. Showcase individual employees as role models and set up opportunities for workers to communicate with one another via support groups, informal meetings and online platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>UPSKILLING AND PROSPERITY</strong></p>\n<p>If this approach to upskilling seems exceptionally complex, that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s addressing an exceptionally complex problem. The assumption that people would be able to easily acquire new skills through vocational or on-the-job training in the future no longer holds true. And as the digital transformation of the global economy continues, the payoff for upskilling can be immense&#8288;&mdash;in economic results, overall quality of life and increased opportunities.</p>",

Design a skills plan:</em></p>\n<p>Base your priorities on the types of jobs that will be affected most by new technologies, the employees who are most at risk and the businesses that have the most to gain.</p>\n<p>Off-the-shelf analytic workforce planning tools can help you estimate the impact of new technologies on companies, the savings that automation will generate, the types of new skills that will be needed and the number of months or years it will take for these changes to happen.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. Assess and advise individual employees:</em></p>\n<p>Some form of individual transformation will take place for participants, sometimes taking them out of their comfort zones. A considered assessment program that includes personal coaching and advice can go a long way toward relieving employees&rsquo; fears.</p>\n<p>For each participant, create an individual skills development plan, defining the steps and training necessary to address the new job requirements or even make broader changes. Ideally, individual workers should feel they&rsquo;re in charge of their own process.<br />\n<br />\n<em>4. Match jobs and engage workers:</em></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s rare to find the perfect match right away; make use of IT systems that quantify the skills gap between the candidate and job requirements.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to ensure positive communication with supervisors, transparency about the project and its implications for employees, encouragement to ask for help when needed, strong support for workers&rsquo; upskilling decisions and standardized rules for all HR advisors.<br />\n<br />\n<em>5. Select training and providers:</em></p>\n<p>The quality, value and efficiency of the training experience affect every aspect of the upskilling initiative, from its costs to employee outlook and motivation. In selecting professional programs, your key criteria are market recognition, track record and the trust built in the past through placing graduates in new jobs.<br />\n<br />\n<em>6. Administer the project and monitor results:</em></p>\n<p>Upskilling is challenging for everyone involved. Bring together the HR departments of relevant companies as administrators, and use digital HR tools to keep track of activity and results.</p>\n<p>Set up a communications plan, publishing success stories and communicating the benefits to the broader community and to the media. Showcase individual employees as role models and set up opportunities for workers to communicate with one another via support groups, informal meetings and online platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>UPSKILLING AND PROSPERITY</strong></p>\n<p>If this approach to upskilling seems exceptionally complex, that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s addressing an exceptionally complex problem. The assumption that people would be able to easily acquire new skills through vocational or on-the-job training in the future no longer holds true. And as the digital transformation of the global economy continues, the payoff for upskilling can be immense&#8288;&mdash;in economic results, overall quality of life and increased opportunities.</p>"

      "summary": "<p>For too long now, the systems we expect people to use at work have been over-complicated and badly designed.

      "description": "<p>Need a taxi? Tap an app and off you go. Fancy a burger in front of Game of Thrones? Grab your phone and wait for the doorbell. But what about booking annual leave with work? Or scheduling a review with your line manager? Or, heaven forbid, logging into the e-learning portal to catch up with your training?</p>\n<p>For too long now, the systems we expect people to use at work have been over-complicated and badly designed. There are multiple stages to get through, forms to complete, hidden buttons and boxes to tick, approval to wait for, windows to open and reopen, functions that crash and inexplicably complex messages that leave you none the wiser.</p>\n<p>Is it really any wonder that HR teams spend their lives chasing people to complete the most basic of tasks?</p>\n<p>Enough is enough. At WorkLifeLabs, we&rsquo;re working with app developers, with UX specialists, with HR teams and with employees to make the technology we interact with at work as user-friendly as the apps we use at home.</p>\n<p>Our first product is an app that quickly and seamlessly connects people to world class professional development coaches. Our new app will radically change the way people experience coaching and dramatically accelerate their development. Beautiful in design, easy to access, simple to navigate, and powerfully engaging, we have leading global organizations already signed up ahead of launch.</p>\n<p>When developing the app, our research into the needs and behaviors of users informed our design process. Here&rsquo;s what I learned:</p>\n<p><strong>1. LESS IS MORE</strong></p>\n<p>Think simple layouts, big buttons and only a couple of functions. That sounds obvious in the real world of UX and design. But one of the main problems with most work systems is they try to do everything and then inevitably fail to do anything well. We wanted to do the opposite.</p>\n<p><strong>2. SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS</strong></p>\n<p>If it takes more than a couple of taps or clicks to get the results you want, people get distracted and move on. (Let&rsquo;s face it, there will always be something more interesting than booking an e-learning course.)</p>\n<p><strong>3. MAKE IT WORK ON A PHONE</strong></p>\n<p>People don&rsquo;t sit at desks all day anymore&mdash;they work from the backs of taxis (that they booked with an app), from shared workspace (that they booked with an app) or from home (where the apps on their phones and TVs make the comparison with work systems even more obvious).</p>\n<p><strong>4. KEEP PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine if Deliveroo required you to pick your food then order via WhatsApp. So many HR systems have corresponding paper forms or separate steps that disrupt the process. With our new app, letting people talk to coaches from within its platform&mdash; instead of via FaceTime or Skype&mdash;has made a huge difference in keeping people engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>5. MAKE IT LOOK GOOD</strong></p>\n<p>People don&rsquo;t judge applications against other HR systems or work technology; they are holding it up against the best brands, the slickest apps and the most seamless websites they encounter every day. Investment in design will never be wasted.</p>\n<p>So, what can you do if you work somewhere with systems that clearly aren&rsquo;t working? Where people don&rsquo;t do what the business needs them to do, or where seemingly simple procedures take up valuable working time?</p>\n<p>Firstly, try the process yourself.

          "textOnly": "<p>Need a taxi? Tap an app and off you go. Fancy a burger in front of Game of Thrones? Grab your phone and wait for the doorbell. But what about booking annual leave with work? Or scheduling a review with your line manager? Or, heaven forbid, logging into the e-learning portal to catch up with your training?</p>\n<p>For too long now, the systems we expect people to use at work have been over-complicated and badly designed. There are multiple stages to get through, forms to complete, hidden buttons and boxes to tick, approval to wait for, windows to open and reopen, functions that crash and inexplicably complex messages that leave you none the wiser.</p>\n<p>Is it really any wonder that HR teams spend their lives chasing people to complete the most basic of tasks?</p>\n<p>Enough is enough. At WorkLifeLabs, we&rsquo;re working with app developers, with UX specialists, with HR teams and with employees to make the technology we interact with at work as user-friendly as the apps we use at home.</p>\n<p>Our first product is an app that quickly and seamlessly connects people to world class professional development coaches. Our new app will radically change the way people experience coaching and dramatically accelerate their development. Beautiful in design, easy to access, simple to navigate, and powerfully engaging, we have leading global organizations already signed up ahead of launch.</p>\n<p>When developing the app, our research into the needs and behaviors of users informed our design process. Here&rsquo;s what I learned:</p>\n<p><strong>1. LESS IS MORE</strong></p>\n<p>Think simple layouts, big buttons and only a couple of functions. That sounds obvious in the real world of UX and design. But one of the main problems with most work systems is they try to do everything and then inevitably fail to do anything well. We wanted to do the opposite.</p>\n<p><strong>2. SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS</strong></p>\n<p>If it takes more than a couple of taps or clicks to get the results you want, people get distracted and move on. (Let&rsquo;s face it, there will always be something more interesting than booking an e-learning course.)</p>\n<p><strong>3. MAKE IT WORK ON A PHONE</strong></p>\n<p>People don&rsquo;t sit at desks all day anymore&mdash;they work from the backs of taxis (that they booked with an app), from shared workspace (that they booked with an app) or from home (where the apps on their phones and TVs make the comparison with work systems even more obvious).</p>\n<p><strong>4. KEEP PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine if Deliveroo required you to pick your food then order via WhatsApp. So many HR systems have corresponding paper forms or separate steps that disrupt the process. With our new app, letting people talk to coaches from within its platform&mdash; instead of via FaceTime or Skype&mdash;has made a huge difference in keeping people engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>5. MAKE IT LOOK GOOD</strong></p>\n<p>People don&rsquo;t judge applications against other HR systems or work technology; they are holding it up against the best brands, the slickest apps and the most seamless websites they encounter every day. Investment in design will never be wasted.</p>\n<p>So, what can you do if you work somewhere with systems that clearly aren&rsquo;t working? Where people don&rsquo;t do what the business needs them to do, or where seemingly simple procedures take up valuable working time?</p>\n<p>Firstly, try the process yourself. Have a go at booking a course, or signing up for a coaching session or even just flagging something with HR. Note the sticking points&mdash;the confusing design, the bits that take you out of the loop, the extra stages that allow you to get distracted. See if there&rsquo;s anything you can do to make it more seamless.</p>\n<p>Ask people what kind of system they&rsquo;d want to use&mdash; and not just what they&rsquo;d want to use every couple of months, but what they&rsquo;d like to have on their phone and use every day.</p>\n<p>Then rewrite anything outdated, redesign anything cluttered and rewire anything complicated. Put user experience first&mdash;just as the creators of the apps you use every day did when they were starting out.</p>\n<p>Creating a great user experience is a mammoth task, and like most great things it takes time and expertise, but even making a couple of changes to the systems you rely on will make a huge difference to productivity and engagement.</p>\n<p>At WorkLifeLabs we&rsquo;re looking to revolutionize the working world by making the technology we use at work as simple, slick and seamless as any app you&rsquo;d use in your everyday life&mdash;even more so, in fact, because it&rsquo;s so unexpected in this world.</p>"

So you&rsquo;re directed to start purchasing hardware and software for a Big Data push to the cloud, organize Hack-a-Thons to unearth a culture of disruption, start running ads on Instagram, install vending machines that only accept crypto currency, create an innovation &ldquo;lab&rdquo; so your clients think you&rsquo;re cooler than you are, and go all-in on social by building a nimble war room so you can tweet stuff during the Oscars. Also, uh... something-something Blockchain.</p>\n<p>Without a strategic foundation, a responsible approach to development, or a full understanding of the people and process implications, these tactics are rarely successful and, worse, are obsolete when 2.0 launches.</p>\n<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not anti-education (Cha Gheil!) and I don&rsquo;t complain about the downtown elites in management with their big fancy degrees. I actually helped launch an Executive MBA at a prestigious university, so I believe in the importance of academic models to business success.</p>\n<p>Still, true organizational change doesn&rsquo;t end with those biz school exercises, it starts with them. Most of the people within an organization have been through enough company-wide transformation initiatives to know that if they just wait long enough, there will be another one by soon enough. They don&rsquo;t know who to trust, so spare them the lecture on why this time it&rsquo;s really going to work.</p>\n<p>So, what do you do?</p>\n<p>Great organizations and great leaders align the actions of all those around them to generate momentum and growth. They don&rsquo;t do this based on some perfectly written mission statement, a few hollow buzzwords, or by chasing the latest tactic.</p>\n<p>They do it with these three pillars:</p>\n<p><em>1. What they think.</em></p>\n<p><em>2. What they do.</em></p>\n<p><em>3. What they say.</em></p>\n<p><strong>THINK: WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE?</strong></p>\n<p>In 1970, Milton Friedman wrote, &ldquo;The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits&rdquo;. For close to 50 years, no one questioned it. In fact, many embraced Friedman&rsquo;s essay to justify any activity that maximized shareholder return. Well, the world has changed and finally, the purpose of the corporation has changed along with it. The Business Roundtable, a group of 181 CEOs (acting for nearly 30% of total U.S. market capitalization), recently declared, &ldquo;Each of our stakeholders is essential. We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.&rdquo; The stakeholders they listed: Employees, Customers, Suppliers, Communities, Shareholders.</p>\n<p>So, yea. The corporation has to believe in something that goes beyond what you sell. Organizations need to go from product to purpose. So do you. An organization can&rsquo;t have a true purpose unless its leaders have a purpose. What do you believe in?</p>\n<p><strong>DO: WHAT DO YOU DO TO REINFORCE YOUR BELIEFS?</strong></p>\n<p>Customers and colleagues don&rsquo;t know who to trust because for decades they&rsquo;ve experienced companies and senior leaders claiming to believe in something, only to find out through organizational actions and personal behaviours, that they don&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>Believing isn&rsquo;t enough. You have to act with intent to reinforce your beliefs. These actions are based on who you do it for, what they want you to do, and who you do it with. Let&rsquo;s face it, the people on your team shouldn&rsquo;t read your values. They should experience them.</p>\n<p><strong>SAY: HOW DO YOU SPREAD THE WORD?</strong></p>\n<p>If you believe in something greater and you behave in ways that reinforce that belief, well, that&rsquo;s worth talking about. And if you&rsquo;re going to talk about it, do as great leaders do: Say it in an authentic, honest, and compelling way that sidesteps business bullshit to have real conversations.</p>\n<p>These are complicated times and they&rsquo;ll get more complex before they get simpler. The noise isn&rsquo;t going away and the demands on people&rsquo;s time are escalating. The trust those people have for companies, institutions, and leaders is eroding.</p>\n<p>You can win that battle. You can think it. You can do it. You can say it.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ll look.

It is instead a part of life &mdash; just as family is, as are friends and community and hobbies. All of these aspects of living have their share of wonderful, uplifting moments and their share of moments that drag us down. The same is true of work, yet when we think of it as an inherent bad in need of a counterweight, we lose sight of the possibility for better.</p>\n<p>It seems more useful, then, to not try to balance the unbalanceable, but to treat work the same way you do life: By maximizing what you love. Here&rsquo;s what we mean.</p>\n<p>Consider why two people doing exactly the same work seem to gain strength and joy from very different moments. When we interviewed several anesthesiologists, we found that while their title and job function are identical, the thrills and chills they feel in their job are not. One said he loved the thrill of holding each patient hovering at that one precise point between life and death, while he shuddered at the &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; of helping each patient get healthy once the operation was complete. Another said she loved the bedside conversations before the operation, and the calm sensitivity required to bring a sedated patient gently back to consciousness without the panic that afflicts many patients. Another was drawn mostly to the intricacies of the anesthetic mechanism itself and has dedicated herself to defining precisely how each drug does what it does. Each one of us, for no good reason other than the clash of our chromosomes, draws strength from different activities, situations, moments and interactions.</p>\n<p>Think of your life&rsquo;s many different activities as threads. Some are black, some are grey and some are white. But some of these activities appear to be made of a different substance. These activities contain all the tell-tale signs of love: before you do them, you find yourself looking forward to them; while you&rsquo;re doing them, time speeds up and you find yourself in flow; and after you&rsquo;ve done them, you feel invigorated. These are your red threads, and&nbsp;research by the Mayo Clinic&nbsp;suggests that doctors who weave the fabric of their life with at least 20% red threads are significantly less likely to experience burnout.</p>\n<p>The simplest way for you to do this is to spend a week in love with your job. This sounds odd, but all it really means is to select a regular week at work and take a pad around with you for the entire week. Down the middle of this pad, draw a vertical line to make two columns, and write &ldquo;Loved It&rdquo; at the top of one column and &ldquo;Loathed It&rdquo; at the top of the other. During the week, any time you find yourself feeling one of the signs of love scribble down exactly what you were doing in the Loved It column. And any time you find yourself feeling the inverse &mdash; before you do something, you procrastinate; while you do it, time drags; and when you&rsquo;re done with it, you hope you never have to do it again &mdash; scribble down exactly what you were doing in the Loathed It column.</p>\n<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;ll be plenty of activities in your week that don&rsquo;t make either list, but if you spend a week in love with your work, by the end of the week you will see a list of activities in your Loved It column that feel different to you than the rest of your work. They&rsquo;ll have a different emotional valence, creating in you a distinct and distinctly positive feeling, one that draws you in and lifts you up.</p>\n<p>Our research (a stratified random sample of the working populations of nineteen countries) reveals that 73% of us claim that we have the freedom to modify our job to fit our strengths better, but that only 18% of us do so. Your challenge, then, is to use your red threads to intelligently change, over time, the content of your job, so that it contains more things that you love doing and fewer that you&rsquo;re aching to escape.</p>\n<p>The most helpful categories for us are not &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;life.&rdquo; We should not struggle to balance the two. Instead, the best categories are &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;loathe.&rdquo; Our goal should be to, little by little, week by week, intentionally&nbsp;<em>imbalance</em>&nbsp;all aspects of our work toward the former and away from the latter. Not simply to make us feel better, but so that our colleagues, our friends and our family can all benefit from us at our very best.</p>\n<p>We can&rsquo;t always do only what we love. But we can always find the love in what we do.</p>",

This sounds odd, but all it really means is to select a regular week at work and take a pad around with you for the entire week. Down the middle of this pad, draw a vertical line to make two columns, and write &ldquo;Loved It&rdquo; at the top of one column and &ldquo;Loathed It&rdquo; at the top of the other. During the week, any time you find yourself feeling one of the signs of love scribble down exactly what you were doing in the Loved It column. And any time you find yourself feeling the inverse &mdash; before you do something, you procrastinate; while you do it, time drags; and when you&rsquo;re done with it, you hope you never have to do it again &mdash; scribble down exactly what you were doing in the Loathed It column.</p>\n<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;ll be plenty of activities in your week that don&rsquo;t make either list, but if you spend a week in love with your work, by the end of the week you will see a list of activities in your Loved It column that feel different to you than the rest of your work. They&rsquo;ll have a different emotional valence, creating in you a distinct and distinctly positive feeling, one that draws you in and lifts you up.</p>\n<p>Our research (a stratified random sample of the working populations of nineteen countries) reveals that 73% of us claim that we have the freedom to modify our job to fit our strengths better, but that only 18% of us do so. Your challenge, then, is to use your red threads to intelligently change, over time, the content of your job, so that it contains more things that you love doing and fewer that you&rsquo;re aching to escape.</p>\n<p>The most helpful categories for us are not &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;life.&rdquo; We should not struggle to balance the two. Instead, the best categories are &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;loathe.&rdquo; Our goal should be to, little by little, week by week, intentionally&nbsp;<em>imbalance</em>&nbsp;all aspects of our work toward the former and away from the latter. Not simply to make us feel better, but so that our colleagues, our friends and our family can all benefit from us at our very best.</p>\n<p>We can&rsquo;t always do only what we love. But we can always find the love in what we do.</p>"

Our propensity to duck, dodge, and defer the conflict that&rsquo;s inevitable in organizations is only redirecting it, intensifying it, and embedding it in our teams. I call this phenomenon conflict debt.</p>\n<p>Conflict debt is the sum of all the undiscussed and unresolved issues that need to be addressed to be able to move forward. Conflict debt is incredibly common for two reasons. First, because conflict is a given in organizations. From the most strategic decisions such as how to make tough trade-offs between priorities, to the most mundane like how to allocate workload, conflict is required. That would be ok were it not for the second fact: while organizations require conflict, humans run from it. We&rsquo;re naturally conflict-averse, and that tendency is only strengthened by our socialization at home and at work to see conflict as not nice, impolite, or uncivil. The result is mounting conflict debt.</p>\n<p>As with any debt, the original cost is compounded the longer you leave it unpaid. With conflict debt, that often comes in the form of growing misalignment, eroding trust, and increasing stress. Once a conflict has been avoided for a while, it&rsquo;s time consuming, delicate work to extricate the team from the mess. In trying to make everything happy and harmonious, we have actually made everyone miserable.</p>\n<p><strong>THE ANSWER MUST BE SYSTEMIC</strong></p>\n<p>For the most part, our answer to insufficient conflict has been to teach conflict skills. We have excellent training on Difficult, Fierce, and Crucial Conversations. The problem is that we are building a skillset that most employees aren&rsquo;t using. We solve for the productive conflict skill, but not for the <em>will</em>.</p>\n<p>What we really need to focus on is making conflict more frequent, lower impact, and more of an ongoing habit rather than a major event. How do we, as leaders, do things that will help employees face fewer unpleasant and uncomfortable conflicts? Here are three ideas you can introduce in your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Neutralize Potential Conflicts</strong></p>\n<p>The frenetic culture in many organizations causes leaders to shortchange planning in favor of action. The irony is that failing to clarify expectations slows things down and sets up unhealthy conflict. Prevent these misunderstandings by helping your team clarify roles and set expectations from the outset.</p>\n<p>Define the unique value you expect each layer in the department to add. Be clear about the everyone&rsquo;s role as work is planned and delegated. Articulate what good work looks like. Specify what value you expect managers to add in first-line review. And just as importantly, be explicit about what you don&rsquo;t want people to do&mdash;the types of issues where you want them to escalate.&nbsp; more conversations about what is expected of everyone will eliminate so many of the unproductive conflicts that come when people don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s expected of them.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Normalize Required Conflicts</strong></p>\n<p>Next, normalize the productive conflict by mapping out the unique value of each role on your team and the tensions that <em>should</em> exist among them. For each role, ask: 1) What is the unique value of your role on this team? What are you paying attention to that no one else is? 2) Which stakeholder is your role most focused on? Who do you serve? 3) What is the most common tension you put on team discussions? What one thing do you have to say in your role that frequently makes others bristle? Answer those questions for each member of a team, emphasizing how the different roles are <em>supposed</em> to be in tension with one another.</p>\n<p>Articulating the productive tensions on your team helps reframe a disagreement; instead of thinking the person is being hostile, it&rsquo;s understood that they are living up to the obligation of their role. With heightened awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Build a Conflict Habit</strong></p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is for productive conflict to become a habit; one employees engage in routinely without requiring significant attention or effort. The secret is to increase the frequency and decrease the intensity of conflict until it becomes a habit that is so natural that no one raises an eyebrow when a conflict emerges. When you develop a conflict habit, people stop taking things personally, their emotions no longer scuttle the conversation, and they don&rsquo;t bother getting defensive&mdash;they just work through the issues and move on.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to introduce healthy conflict, particularly into your meetings. Set meeting ground rules where everyone is expected to improve the quality of the discussion with one or more of the following: test statements passed off as facts by asking for the supporting evidence; introduce diversity by exploring a different side of an issue or thinking from the point of view of another stakeholder; expose risks in plans by highlighting assumptions or imagining the implications. Don&rsquo;t try to build a conflict habit by starting with the most contentious issue you&rsquo;ve been burying for months. Instead, build the habit over time by teaching people to be comfortable being uncomfortable.</p>\n<p><strong>PREVENT UNPRODUCTIVE CONFLICT</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations require conflict but humans run from it. If we&rsquo;re going to address this gap without getting into conflict debt, we&rsquo;re going to need a something more than conversation training. First, we need to do a better job of clarifying expectations so we can neutralize many conflicts before they happen. Next, we need to normalize the productive tensions on our teams so they aren&rsquo;t interpreted as interpersonal friction. Finally, we need to build a conflict habit so that conflict becomes much more frequent but lower impact. We, as leaders, have a critical role to play in creating a culture of productive conflict.</p>",

      "summary": "",
      "description": "<p>This book is a result of an exhaustive study undertaken by the Gallup organization involving 80,000 managers across a large number of industries exploring the concepts of employee satisfaction, selecting and maintaining good employees, and means of measuring employee satisfaction. The approach was revolutionary when published (1999) and has become a business classic because it challenged the status quo. First Break All the Rules asserts that the status quo is counterproductive and encourages management to adopt innovative approaches to employee engagement. There are four keys for unlocking potential in your employees: select for talents, suggest outcomes rather than direct control of process, focus on employees&rsquo; strengths and work around weaknesses, and finally find the right fit for your employees.</p>\n<p><strong>The Big Idea: Measuring Stick</strong></p>\n<p>If you are in business, it is paramount to know how you are performing relative to your competition through the eyes of your employees. With rigorous research and data analysis Gallup isolated 12 questions that strongly reflect a company&rsquo;s success:</p>\n<p><em>1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?</em><br />\n<em>2. Do I have the equipment and material I need to do my work right?</em><br />\n<em>3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?</em><br />\n<em>4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?</em><br />\n<em>5. Does my supervisor or someone at work seem to care about me as a person?</em><br />\n<em>6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?</em><br />\n<em>7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?</em><br />\n<em>8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my work is important?</em><br />\n<em>9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?</em><br />\n<em>10. Do I have a best friend at work?</em><br />\n<em>11. In the last six months, have I talked to someone about my progress?</em><br />\n<em>12. This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?</em></p>\n<p>As a manager it is your responsibility that your employees reply with an emphatic &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to these questions. Positive responses to these questions were strongly correlated to profitability, productivity, employee retention, and customer satisfaction. If you can generate positive responses to these questions, then you have the ability to attract and retain quality employees. The importance of influential perks, pay, or a charismatic CEO were not established in the author&rsquo;s research.</p>\n<p><strong>Insight #1: Identifying and Understanding Talent</strong></p>\n<p>Great managers know that every role in a workplace requires talent because there are recurring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.

          "textOnly": "<p>This book is a result of an exhaustive study undertaken by the Gallup organization involving 80,000 managers across a large number of industries exploring the concepts of employee satisfaction, selecting and maintaining good employees, and means of measuring employee satisfaction. The approach was revolutionary when published (1999) and has become a business classic because it challenged the status quo. First Break All the Rules asserts that the status quo is counterproductive and encourages management to adopt innovative approaches to employee engagement. There are four keys for unlocking potential in your employees: select for talents, suggest outcomes rather than direct control of process, focus on employees&rsquo; strengths and work around weaknesses, and finally find the right fit for your employees.</p>\n<p><strong>The Big Idea: Measuring Stick</strong></p>\n<p>If you are in business, it is paramount to know how you are performing relative to your competition through the eyes of your employees. With rigorous research and data analysis Gallup isolated 12 questions that strongly reflect a company&rsquo;s success:</p>\n<p><em>1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?</em><br />\n<em>2. Do I have the equipment and material I need to do my work right?</em><br />\n<em>3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?</em><br />\n<em>4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?</em><br />\n<em>5. Does my supervisor or someone at work seem to care about me as a person?</em><br />\n<em>6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?</em><br />\n<em>7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?</em><br />\n<em>8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my work is important?</em><br />\n<em>9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?</em><br />\n<em>10. Do I have a best friend at work?</em><br />\n<em>11. In the last six months, have I talked to someone about my progress?</em><br />\n<em>12. This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?</em></p>\n<p>As a manager it is your responsibility that your employees reply with an emphatic &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to these questions. Positive responses to these questions were strongly correlated to profitability, productivity, employee retention, and customer satisfaction. If you can generate positive responses to these questions, then you have the ability to attract and retain quality employees. The importance of influential perks, pay, or a charismatic CEO were not established in the author&rsquo;s research.</p>\n<p><strong>Insight #1: Identifying and Understanding Talent</strong></p>\n<p>Great managers know that every role in a workplace requires talent because there are recurring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Managers that are able to select for these patterns will have more harmonious results on their team. One of the biggest mistake managers make is selecting for other factors like experience or intelligence, and ignore required talents (for example, empathy is a required trait for nurses).

      "description": "<p><em>Try this revolutionary approach to mandatory vacation.</em></p>\n<p>Have you ever felt burned out at work after a vacation?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about being exhausted from fighting with your family at Walt Disney World all week. I&rsquo;m talking about how you knew, the whole time walking around Epcot, that a world of work was waiting for you upon your return.</p>\n<p>Our vacation systems are completely broken. They don&rsquo;t work. The classic corporate vacation system goes something like this: You get a set number of vacation days a year (often only two to three weeks), you fill out some 1996-era form to apply for time off, you get your boss&rsquo;s signature, and then you file it with a team assistant or log it in some terrible database. It&rsquo;s an administrative headache. Then most people have to frantically cram extra work into the week before they leave for vacation in order to actually extract themselves from the office. By the time we finally turn on our out-of-office messages, we&rsquo;re beyond stressed, and we know that we&rsquo;ll have an even bigger pile of work waiting for us when we return. What a nightmare.</p>\n<p>For most of us, it&rsquo;s hard to actually use vacation time to recharge. So, it&rsquo;s no wonder that absenteeism remains a massive problem for most companies, with payrolls dotted with sick leaves, disability leaves, and stress leaves.</p>\n<p>In the UK, the Department for Work and Pensions says that absenteeism costs the country&rsquo;s economy more than &pound;100 billion per year. A white paper published by the Workforce Institute and produced by Circadian, a workforce solutions company, calls absenteeism a bottom-line killer that costs employers $3,600 per hourly employee and $2,650 per salaried employee per year. It doesn&rsquo;t help that, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the United States is the only country out of 21 wealthy countries that doesn&rsquo;t require employers to offer paid vacation time.</p>\n<p>Would it help if we got more paid vacation? Not necessarily. According to a study from the U.S. Travel Association and GfK, a market research firm, just over 40% of Americans plan not to use all their paid time off anyway. So what&rsquo;s the progressive approach? Is it the Adobe, Netflix, or Twitter policies that say take as much vacation as you want, whenever you want it? Open-ended, unlimited vacation sounds great on paper, doesn&rsquo;t it? Very progressive, right? No, that approach is broken too.</p>\n<p>What happens in practice with unlimited vacation time? Warrior mentality. Peer pressure. Social signals that say you&rsquo;re a slacker if you&rsquo;re not in the office. Mathias Meyer, the CEO of German tech company Travis CI, wrote about his company abandoning its unlimited vacation policy: &ldquo;When people are uncertain about how many days it&rsquo;s okay to take off, you&rsquo;ll see curious things happen. People will hesitate to take a vacation as they don&rsquo;t want to seem like that person who&rsquo;s taking the most vacation days. It&rsquo;s a race to the bottom instead of a race towards a well-rested and happy team.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution?</p>\n<p>Recurring scheduled mandatory vacation.</p>\n<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;an entirely new approach to managing vacation. And one that preliminary research shows works much more effectively.</p>\n<p>Designer Stefan Sagmeister said in his TED talk, &ldquo;The Power of Time Off,&rdquo; that every seven years he takes one year off. &ldquo;In that year,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine, it is a lovely and very energetic time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I thought about this when I recently collaborated with Shashank Nigam, the CEO of SimpliFlying, a global aviation strategy firm of about 10 people, to ask a simple question: &ldquo;What if we force people to take a scheduled week off every seven weeks?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The idea was that this would be a microcosm of the Sagmeister principle of one week off every seven years. And it was entirely mandatory. In fact, we designed it so that if you contacted the office while you were on vacation&mdash; whether through email, WhatsApp, Slack, or anything else&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t get paid for that vacation week. We tried to build in a financial punishment for working when you aren&rsquo;t supposed to be working, in order to establish a norm about disconnecting from the office.</p>\n<p>The system is designed so that you don&rsquo;t get a say in when you go. Some may say that&rsquo;s a downside, but for this experiment, we believed that putting a structure in place would be a significant benefit. The team and clients would know well ahead of time when someone would be taking a week off. And the point is you actually go. And everybody goes. So there are no questions, paperwork, or guilt involved with not being at the office.</p>\n<p>After this experiment was in place for 12 weeks, we had managers rate employee productivity, creativity, and happiness levels before and after the mandatory time off. (We used a five point Likert scale, using simple statements such as &ldquo;Ravi is demonstrating creativity in his work,&rdquo; with the options ranging from one, Strongly Disagree, to five, Strongly Agree.) And what did we find out?</p>\n<p>Creativity went up 33%, happiness levels rose 25%, and productivity increased 13%.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a small sample, sure, but there&rsquo;s a meaningful story here as the data complements feedback we got from employees who, upon their return, wrote blog posts about their experiences with the process and what they did with their time. Many talked about how people finally found time to cross things off of their bucket lists&mdash;holding an art exhibition, learning a new language, or traveling somewhere they&rsquo;d never been before.</p>\n<p>Now, this is a small company, and we haven&rsquo;t tested the results in a large organization.</p>\n<p>But the question is: Could something this simple work in your workplace?</p>\n<p>There were two points of constructive feedback that came back from the test:</p>\n<p><strong>&bull; FREQUENCY WAS TOO HIGH.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Employees found that once every seven weeks (while beautiful on paper) was just too frequent for a small company like SimpliFlying. Its competitive advantage is agility, and having staff take time off too often upset the work rhythm. Nigam proposed adjusting it to every 12 weeks. But with employee input, we redesigned it to once every eight weeks.</em></p>\n<p><strong>&bull; STAGGERING WAS IMPORTANT.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Let&rsquo;s say that two or three people work together on a project team. We found that it didn&rsquo;t make sense for these people to take time off back-to-back. Batons get dropped if there are consecutive absences. We revised the arrangement so that no one can take a week off right after someone has just come back from one. The high-level design is important and needs to work for the business.</em></p>\n<p>This is early research, but it confirms something we said at the beginning: Vacation systems are broken and aren&rsquo;t actually doing what they&rsquo;re advertised to do. If you show up drained after your vacation, that means you didn&rsquo;t get the benefit of creating space.</p>\n<p>Why is creating space so important? Consider this quote from Tim Kreider, who wrote &ldquo;The &lsquo;Busy&rsquo; Trap&rdquo; for the New York Times:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets. The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspiration&mdash;it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Fix your vacation system. You&rsquo;ll be doing better, more important work.</p>",

So, it&rsquo;s no wonder that absenteeism remains a massive problem for most companies, with payrolls dotted with sick leaves, disability leaves, and stress leaves.</p>\n<p>In the UK, the Department for Work and Pensions says that absenteeism costs the country&rsquo;s economy more than &pound;100 billion per year. A white paper published by the Workforce Institute and produced by Circadian, a workforce solutions company, calls absenteeism a bottom-line killer that costs employers $3,600 per hourly employee and $2,650 per salaried employee per year. It doesn&rsquo;t help that, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the United States is the only country out of 21 wealthy countries that doesn&rsquo;t require employers to offer paid vacation time.</p>\n<p>Would it help if we got more paid vacation? Not necessarily. According to a study from the U.S. Travel Association and GfK, a market research firm, just over 40% of Americans plan not to use all their paid time off anyway. So what&rsquo;s the progressive approach? Is it the Adobe, Netflix, or Twitter policies that say take as much vacation as you want, whenever you want it? Open-ended, unlimited vacation sounds great on paper, doesn&rsquo;t it? Very progressive, right? No, that approach is broken too.</p>\n<p>What happens in practice with unlimited vacation time? Warrior mentality. Peer pressure. Social signals that say you&rsquo;re a slacker if you&rsquo;re not in the office. Mathias Meyer, the CEO of German tech company Travis CI, wrote about his company abandoning its unlimited vacation policy: &ldquo;When people are uncertain about how many days it&rsquo;s okay to take off, you&rsquo;ll see curious things happen. People will hesitate to take a vacation as they don&rsquo;t want to seem like that person who&rsquo;s taking the most vacation days. It&rsquo;s a race to the bottom instead of a race towards a well-rested and happy team.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution?</p>\n<p>Recurring scheduled mandatory vacation.</p>\n<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;an entirely new approach to managing vacation. And one that preliminary research shows works much more effectively.</p>\n<p>Designer Stefan Sagmeister said in his TED talk, &ldquo;The Power of Time Off,&rdquo; that every seven years he takes one year off. &ldquo;In that year,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine, it is a lovely and very energetic time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I thought about this when I recently collaborated with Shashank Nigam, the CEO of SimpliFlying, a global aviation strategy firm of about 10 people, to ask a simple question: &ldquo;What if we force people to take a scheduled week off every seven weeks?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The idea was that this would be a microcosm of the Sagmeister principle of one week off every seven years. And it was entirely mandatory. In fact, we designed it so that if you contacted the office while you were on vacation&mdash; whether through email, WhatsApp, Slack, or anything else&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t get paid for that vacation week. We tried to build in a financial punishment for working when you aren&rsquo;t supposed to be working, in order to establish a norm about disconnecting from the office.</p>\n<p>The system is designed so that you don&rsquo;t get a say in when you go. Some may say that&rsquo;s a downside, but for this experiment, we believed that putting a structure in place would be a significant benefit. The team and clients would know well ahead of time when someone would be taking a week off. And the point is you actually go. And everybody goes. So there are no questions, paperwork, or guilt involved with not being at the office.</p>\n<p>After this experiment was in place for 12 weeks, we had managers rate employee productivity, creativity, and happiness levels before and after the mandatory time off. (We used a five point Likert scale, using simple statements such as &ldquo;Ravi is demonstrating creativity in his work,&rdquo; with the options ranging from one, Strongly Disagree, to five, Strongly Agree.) And what did we find out?</p>\n<p>Creativity went up 33%, happiness levels rose 25%, and productivity increased 13%.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a small sample, sure, but there&rsquo;s a meaningful story here as the data complements feedback we got from employees who, upon their return, wrote blog posts about their experiences with the process and what they did with their time. Many talked about how people finally found time to cross things off of their bucket lists&mdash;holding an art exhibition, learning a new language, or traveling somewhere they&rsquo;d never been before.</p>\n<p>Now, this is a small company, and we haven&rsquo;t tested the results in a large organization.</p>\n<p>But the question is: Could something this simple work in your workplace?</p>\n<p>There were two points of constructive feedback that came back from the test:</p>\n<p><strong>&bull; FREQUENCY WAS TOO HIGH.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Employees found that once every seven weeks (while beautiful on paper) was just too frequent for a small company like SimpliFlying. Its competitive advantage is agility, and having staff take time off too often upset the work rhythm. Nigam proposed adjusting it to every 12 weeks. But with employee input, we redesigned it to once every eight weeks.</em></p>\n<p><strong>&bull; STAGGERING WAS IMPORTANT.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Let&rsquo;s say that two or three people work together on a project team. We found that it didn&rsquo;t make sense for these people to take time off back-to-back. Batons get dropped if there are consecutive absences. We revised the arrangement so that no one can take a week off right after someone has just come back from one. The high-level design is important and needs to work for the business.</em></p>\n<p>This is early research, but it confirms something we said at the beginning: Vacation systems are broken and aren&rsquo;t actually doing what they&rsquo;re advertised to do. If you show up drained after your vacation, that means you didn&rsquo;t get the benefit of creating space.</p>\n<p>Why is creating space so important? Consider this quote from Tim Kreider, who wrote &ldquo;The &lsquo;Busy&rsquo; Trap&rdquo; for the New York Times:</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as vitamin D is to the body and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets. The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspiration&mdash;it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Fix your vacation system. You&rsquo;ll be doing better, more important work.</p>"

      "summary": "<p>Managing the generation gap is all about empowering employees and showing them respect. Done effectively, your organization will benefit with increased sales.&nbsp;</p>",
      "description": "<p>Today, there are three, sometimes four, generations working side by side in any given workplace. And no matter how you cut it, there are bound to be instances where the age gap impacts productivity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key is to find ways to make the gap work in your organization's favor, instead of allowing generational misunderstandings drag at productivity and sales.</p>\n<p>At the new CPSA (Canadian Professional Sales Association) we've developed tools, certifications, webinars and other resources to help you accelerate individual and organizational success, including managing the generation gap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are three main generations in today's workplace: Baby Boomers (born between 1946-1964); Generation X (1965-1979); and Millennials, also called Heneration Y or Echo Boomers, (born in the 1980s and 1990s). Veterans (1930-1945) can also be found in some organizations, usually in consulting roles, and Generation Z (born in the 21st century) will soon be entering. With such an eclectic demographic mix, there are sure to be potential conflicts and misconceptions.</p>\n<p>As states, the key for every organization is to blend together the workers of all ages - mining the strengths of each and mitigating everyone's weaknesses as best as possible - to heighten productivity and grow sales.</p>\n<p>There's a dearth of information about the generational divide, even how Millennials are taking over and changing the workplace in their image: technology friven, known for speaking their minds and thinking outside the box. There may be some truth in that, but there are myths as well, as proven by some interesting recent research by Robert Half Management Resouces, a U.S. - based provider of senior-level finance, accounting and business systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In How Do Generations Of Workers Differ?, Robert Half found each age demographic exhibits its own styles and approaches, but also have things in common. Indeed, when executives were asked to rank the differences the top four were: communication skills (30 per cent); adapting to change (26 per cent); and cross-departmental collaboration (14 per cent).</p>\n<p>At the CPSA, we believe in finding the generational commonalities and flattening out the differences. For example, our enhanced professional credentials, the Certified Sales Associate (CSA), Certified Sales Professional (CSP) and Certified Sales Leader (CSL) all help in this regard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each requires hard work to attain, but by creating consistent skillsets and bases of knowledge, they help bridge the gap by equalizing everyone in sales whether they have 37 years of experience or 24 months of experience. At the levels of CSA, CSP and CSL, each requires ongoing professional development to maintain the certification, which also helps bridge the gap by continually strengthening commonalities and flattening out differences.</p>\n<p>Of course, our designations are only part of the solution. The CPSA strives to fortify businesses' productivity by identifying and evaluating weaknesses, providing valuable solutions and savvy ideas for today's competitive marketplaces. Our customized resources empower organizations to strengthen and develop competencies to improve the overall output of the business.</p>\n<p>In terms of the generation gap, our CPSA team has compiled a list of meaningful tactics and approaches to bridge the generational gap in every organization:</p>\n<p><strong>Outlaw Generation Bashing</strong></p>\n<p>Millennials are sick of hearing about their \"everyone gets a trophy\" upbringing and stereotypes about not working hard enough or being difficult to manage. Boomers don't like being labelled technological Neanderthals and out of date with how things should be done. GenXers often feel thwarted by older folks above them clogging up promotion paths and under pressure as Millennials begin to crowd the workplace and earn promotions. Such frustrations can surface in numerous ways. When any negative expressions occur between generations, open an honest dialogue quickly. The fact is, most office relationship issues are interpersonal, not generational. As a leader, you don't really want to deal with employee arguments. But, when necessary, you need to understand both employees' mindsets and why they feel a need to stand their ground. This is where frame of reference comes into play. Being able to understand where someone is coming from can get you a long way, and it doesn't have to be hard if you allow yourself to see things from their perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Create An Open Communication Culture (and mean it!)</strong></p>\n<p>Napoleon was spot on when he said \"the key to victory lies in the communications\" and it applies more than ever to today's workplaces. First, find out how staff members like to communicate. You might be surprised to find research indivating all generations prefer communicating face-to-face for important issues, then phone, email and text is last. Somewhat surprising, Millennials say they despise work-related texts. Second, since open communication between different generations isn't always easy to cultivate, sometimes it takes a little push from management to get things on the right track. Try holding roundtable discussions that include all generations of employee at times like kicking off projects such as finding new prospective clients or developing and updating the organization's sales training courses and protocols. Institute reverse mentorships, where less-seasoned staff advise and share their insights with veteran colleagues. Invite team members from all generations to share their unique areas of expertise. Don't overthink it, but mix generations as often as possible. Offsite meetings can be good for different ages to get to know and understand each other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Beware of the KIA and Promote New Ideas, Open-Mindedness</strong></p>\n<p>The KIA (the dreaded \"Know It All\") can blow up generation bridges quickly, regardless if the KIA is young or old. No organization benefits from self-righteous lectures about how things were done back in the day or smug sermons laced with techno-jargon about how things should be done today. Seasoned workers must be open to learning from younger people, just as the juniors should tap into the experience of the seniors and not mock them for living in yeteryear. Where possible, encourage mentoring and coaching, but in today's style\" two-way exchange of information where the older worker shares experiences and the younger reveals things like technological tips and generational terminology. In other words, bring the generations together in forums of open-mindedness and collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid \"One-Size Fits All\" Management</strong></p>\n<p>Create a culture where each staff member's individual personality, skills, and needs are taken into account. Much, if not all of this will have to do with understanding your employees and what makes them tick. As long as you aren't approaching everyone in the same manner, you'll be on your way to a well-devised management plan to bridge the gap. This is why it's so important for people in leadership positions to know exactly what sets the generations apart. There is a wealth of information available online that covers why and how each generation is unique, and it can be beneficial for management to get caught up. The more well-versed your leadership staff is, the easier it will be to properly manage the generation gap in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Managing the generation gap is all about empowering employees and showing them respect. Done effectively, your organization will benefit with increased sales.&nbsp;</p>",

And no matter how you cut it, there are bound to be instances where the age gap impacts productivity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key is to find ways to make the gap work in your organization's favor, instead of allowing generational misunderstandings drag at productivity and sales.</p>\n<p>At the new CPSA (Canadian Professional Sales Association) we've developed tools, certifications, webinars and other resources to help you accelerate individual and organizational success, including managing the generation gap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are three main generations in today's workplace: Baby Boomers (born between 1946-1964); Generation X (1965-1979); and Millennials, also called Heneration Y or Echo Boomers, (born in the 1980s and 1990s). Veterans (1930-1945) can also be found in some organizations, usually in consulting roles, and Generation Z (born in the 21st century) will soon be entering. With such an eclectic demographic mix, there are sure to be potential conflicts and misconceptions.</p>\n<p>As states, the key for every organization is to blend together the workers of all ages - mining the strengths of each and mitigating everyone's weaknesses as best as possible - to heighten productivity and grow sales.</p>\n<p>There's a dearth of information about the generational divide, even how Millennials are taking over and changing the workplace in their image: technology friven, known for speaking their minds and thinking outside the box. There may be some truth in that, but there are myths as well, as proven by some interesting recent research by Robert Half Management Resouces, a U.S. - based provider of senior-level finance, accounting and business systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In How Do Generations Of Workers Differ?, Robert Half found each age demographic exhibits its own styles and approaches, but also have things in common. Indeed, when executives were asked to rank the differences the top four were: communication skills (30 per cent); adapting to change (26 per cent); and cross-departmental collaboration (14 per cent).</p>\n<p>At the CPSA, we believe in finding the generational commonalities and flattening out the differences. For example, our enhanced professional credentials, the Certified Sales Associate (CSA), Certified Sales Professional (CSP) and Certified Sales Leader (CSL) all help in this regard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each requires hard work to attain, but by creating consistent skillsets and bases of knowledge, they help bridge the gap by equalizing everyone in sales whether they have 37 years of experience or 24 months of experience. At the levels of CSA, CSP and CSL, each requires ongoing professional development to maintain the certification, which also helps bridge the gap by continually strengthening commonalities and flattening out differences.</p>\n<p>Of course, our designations are only part of the solution. The CPSA strives to fortify businesses' productivity by identifying and evaluating weaknesses, providing valuable solutions and savvy ideas for today's competitive marketplaces. Our customized resources empower organizations to strengthen and develop competencies to improve the overall output of the business.</p>\n<p>In terms of the generation gap, our CPSA team has compiled a list of meaningful tactics and approaches to bridge the generational gap in every organization:</p>\n<p><strong>Outlaw Generation Bashing</strong></p>\n<p>Millennials are sick of hearing about their \"everyone gets a trophy\" upbringing and stereotypes about not working hard enough or being difficult to manage. Boomers don't like being labelled technological Neanderthals and out of date with how things should be done. GenXers often feel thwarted by older folks above them clogging up promotion paths and under pressure as Millennials begin to crowd the workplace and earn promotions. Such frustrations can surface in numerous ways. When any negative expressions occur between generations, open an honest dialogue quickly. The fact is, most office relationship issues are interpersonal, not generational. As a leader, you don't really want to deal with employee arguments. But, when necessary, you need to understand both employees' mindsets and why they feel a need to stand their ground. This is where frame of reference comes into play. Being able to understand where someone is coming from can get you a long way, and it doesn't have to be hard if you allow yourself to see things from their perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Create An Open Communication Culture (and mean it!)</strong></p>\n<p>Napoleon was spot on when he said \"the key to victory lies in the communications\" and it applies more than ever to today's workplaces. First, find out how staff members like to communicate. You might be surprised to find research indivating all generations prefer communicating face-to-face for important issues, then phone, email and text is last. Somewhat surprising, Millennials say they despise work-related texts. Second, since open communication between different generations isn't always easy to cultivate, sometimes it takes a little push from management to get things on the right track. Try holding roundtable discussions that include all generations of employee at times like kicking off projects such as finding new prospective clients or developing and updating the organization's sales training courses and protocols. Institute reverse mentorships, where less-seasoned staff advise and share their insights with veteran colleagues. Invite team members from all generations to share their unique areas of expertise. Don't overthink it, but mix generations as often as possible. Offsite meetings can be good for different ages to get to know and understand each other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Beware of the KIA and Promote New Ideas, Open-Mindedness</strong></p>\n<p>The KIA (the dreaded \"Know It All\") can blow up generation bridges quickly, regardless if the KIA is young or old. No organization benefits from self-righteous lectures about how things were done back in the day or smug sermons laced with techno-jargon about how things should be done today. Seasoned workers must be open to learning from younger people, just as the juniors should tap into the experience of the seniors and not mock them for living in yeteryear. Where possible, encourage mentoring and coaching, but in today's style\" two-way exchange of information where the older worker shares experiences and the younger reveals things like technological tips and generational terminology. In other words, bring the generations together in forums of open-mindedness and collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid \"One-Size Fits All\" Management</strong></p>\n<p>Create a culture where each staff member's individual personality, skills, and needs are taken into account. Much, if not all of this will have to do with understanding your employees and what makes them tick. As long as you aren't approaching everyone in the same manner, you'll be on your way to a well-devised management plan to bridge the gap. This is why it's so important for people in leadership positions to know exactly what sets the generations apart. There is a wealth of information available online that covers why and how each generation is unique, and it can be beneficial for management to get caught up. The more well-versed your leadership staff is, the easier it will be to properly manage the generation gap in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Managing the generation gap is all about empowering employees and showing them respect. Done effectively, your organization will benefit with increased sales.&nbsp;</p>"

They take as much as they can from the job, for as long as they can, without regard to the welfare of anyone else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>3.

They believe that demeaning the people they lead is a sign of strength.</p>\n<p><em><strong>4.

These leaders simply do not have the right instincts for leadership.</p>\n<p><em><strong>5. Lack of Initiative</strong></em></p>\n<p>When decisive action is needed, these leaders delay, defer, procrastinate and prevaricate. They show up every day and do nothing and hope that nobody notices.</p>\n<p>As profound as these results were, the real emotional impact for me came from the open-ended responses that we captured.</p>\n<p>I asked respondents to describe in their own words how mediocre leadership impacts them personally. The responses ranged from disappointed and angry to despondent.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a struggle to come to work,&rdquo; said one middle manager from North America. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse if you manage a group of people who look up to you. Slowly but surely, you die a little at a time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Death by mediocre leader was a constant theme in the open-ended responses. &ldquo;Mediocre leaders suck the very energy, drive and &lsquo;can do&rsquo; spirit out of you,&rdquo; said another manager.</p>\n<p>It was hard to ignore the link between mediocre leaders and mediocre performance. &ldquo;When leaders ignore their best people and ideas, maintaining the status quo is easiest for them,&rdquo; said another middle manager from North America. &ldquo;After a while, we&rsquo;re all just treading water.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there is hope. It will require some dedicated effort, but there is a solution to mediocre leadership: accountable leadership.</p>\n<p>In my book, <em>The Leadership Contract</em>, I suggest that leaders and their organizations adopt behaviors and mindsets that demonstrate strong accountability at a personal and collective level. In other words, I ask them to commit to what I call the four terms of the Leadership Contract.</p>\n<p>The first term is that leadership is a decision, and that you have to make it. You must be all in and define yourself as a leader. To be an accountable and maybe even a great leader needs your full commitment. Anything less and you run the risk of becoming mediocre.</p>\n<p>The second term notes that leadership is an obligation, and you have to step up. You need have a clear sense of your obligations as a leader, and a commitment that you will leave your organization in a better place than you found it. It&rsquo;s about leaving a lasting and positive legacy.</p>\n<p>The third term acknowledges that leadership is hard work and you have to get tough to tackle it. Far too many leaders only like the easy tasks of leadership. But, being a leader requires you to make unpopular decisions, give frank feedback to colleagues, and call out unproductive behavior. These are hard things to do, but necessary if our organizations are to succeed. If you avoid the hard work, you weaken yourself, your team and your company.</p>\n<p>The final term notes that leadership is a community and you need to connect with your fellow leaders. Too many leaders are disconnected from one another. To be an effective leader, you must build relationships with peers and colleagues across the organization. You need to break down silos and actively network to share ideas and drive innovation.</p>\n<p>Mediocre leadership is a scourge that drains the engagement and productivity out of your organization. Left unattended, it will drive down results, and drive out your top talent.</p>\n<p>The antidote is within reach. You must sign the leadership contract and lead with accountability. It&rsquo;s the quickest and most enduring way to improve your leadership.</p>",

This foundation helps to keep an&nbsp;effective leader grounded and focused, and helps their team and business thrive in times&nbsp;of change.</p>\n<p><strong>BE PASSIONATE</strong></p>\n<p>Work is not a place, but a thing we do. It&rsquo;s a part&nbsp;of our lives. When you are passionate about&nbsp;your work and career, it shows, and is a critical&nbsp;differentiation in today&rsquo;s hyper-competitive&nbsp;world. People often ask what it takes to have a&nbsp;successful career. Working-hard, being resultsdriven, having organizational agility, being&nbsp;strategic, etc.&hellip;. those are all table-stakes. If&nbsp;two people possess all those qualities, the one&nbsp;who is more passionate will win every time.&nbsp;Why? Because passion is powerful. It will&nbsp;motivate you to always go the extra mile, not&nbsp;because you must, but because you are excited&nbsp;to see the impact it will drive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And when you are passionate, everyone&nbsp;around you will know it, and be motivated by&nbsp;it. Your team will be excited, and customers&nbsp;will feel valued. But best of all, you will love&nbsp;what you do.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ask yourself, what is my why? What&nbsp;drives you and pushes you forward.&nbsp;Whatever it is, that is your why. Its why you&nbsp;do what you do. Your why should be used&nbsp;as a guidepost to decide what companies&nbsp;and roles to take next. If you&rsquo;re like me, your&nbsp;why may be multiple things. Your why could&nbsp;be that you whole heartedly believe in the&nbsp;work you are doing and how technology is&nbsp;enabling human potential. Your why could&nbsp;be that you want to build a better world&nbsp;for your children or the community around&nbsp;you. Whatever your why is; knowing it is&nbsp;important. Your why will fuel your passion&nbsp;and your career.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BUILD YOUR BRAND</strong></p>\n<p>News flash &ndash; you already have a brand.&nbsp;Whether you have created it or not, people&nbsp;already have an opinion about you. Your&nbsp;brand represents who you are at home, in&nbsp;your company and in your community. A&nbsp;good brand conveys credibility, quality and&nbsp;experience, and can open doors for you. A&nbsp;bad or mis-informed brand, on the other hand, can severely limit your possibilities. So why not take control of your brand instead of letting your brand control you and your career?</p>\n<p>When it comes to leadership, knowing your brand is critically important. Possessing the self-awareness to recognize what works for you and where you need to make some changes is equally important. Identify the three areas that you want to be known for; establish areas of expertise; prioritize your time and resources; and consistently demonstrate your capabilities and commitment in those areas. Being true to your brand helps people know what to expect from you and can inspire and drive confidence in your team.</p>\n<p><strong>HAVE A VISION</strong></p>\n<p>Develop a big picture vision for where you want your career to go. Focus not only on your next role, but also on two to three roles ahead. Take roles that both leverage skills you already have, enabling a fast start, and allow you to gain new skills to continue to grow and develop. And when a job takes you off your path, or a role no longer sparks your passion, then consider changing roles. It&rsquo;s easier to succeed when you know what success looks like for you and the path you must take to get there.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where you are in your career journey, your vision should also include a focus on how you will lead. At Dell Technologies we look at seven categories of leadership that include relationships, drive, judgement, vision, optimism, humility, and selflessness. Through regular surveys, we measure our leadership team on these characteristics. We do this to better understand which characteristics a successful leader possesses. There&rsquo;s good news. Our studies shows that you do not need to master all these skills. However, a successful leader must be exceptional at one of these skills.</p>\n<p>Once you know how you will lead, build upon it; be authentic and true to your leadership style. For example, if you know that building relationships is one of your strengths, leverage that to build your team and customer loyalty, and to drive differentiated high-performing interactions.</p>\n<p>A well thought-through foundation for leadership will morph over the course of your career. I encourage you to adjust and build upon it. Stay true to your goals and let your foundation serve as your guide to success as a leader.&nbsp;</p>",

It&rsquo;s easier to succeed when you know what success looks like for you and the path you must take to get there.</p>\n<p>Regardless of where you are in your career journey, your vision should also include a focus on how you will lead. At Dell Technologies we look at seven categories of leadership that include relationships, drive, judgement, vision, optimism, humility, and selflessness. Through regular surveys, we measure our leadership team on these characteristics. We do this to better understand which characteristics a successful leader possesses. There&rsquo;s good news. Our studies shows that you do not need to master all these skills. However, a successful leader must be exceptional at one of these skills.</p>\n<p>Once you know how you will lead, build upon it; be authentic and true to your leadership style. For example, if you know that building relationships is one of your strengths, leverage that to build your team and customer loyalty, and to drive differentiated high-performing interactions.</p>\n<p>A well thought-through foundation for leadership will morph over the course of your career. I encourage you to adjust and build upon it. Stay true to your goals and let your foundation serve as your guide to success as a leader.&nbsp;</p>"

      "description": "<p>At a point of feeling overwhelmed at work several years ago, I told my husband (only half-jokingly) I was going to leave my career to bag groceries at the store down the street.</p>\n<p>I tried convincing him that the hypothetical cut to our income would be more than offset by the reduction in my stress level. He was unconvinced. &ldquo;I support any decision you make,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;but I know you would find the stress in that job as well.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He was right. I wasn&rsquo;t trapped in a high-stress job; I was trapped in a high-stress mentality.</p>\n<p>Many female leaders share this mentality&mdash;striving for success but haunted by other thoughts. I describe this feeling using the question, &ldquo;Did I leave the stove on?&rdquo; This thought sparks the mild but persistent anxiety that we should be doing more, or that we are forgetting something important.</p>\n<p>Even though many women burn the candle at both ends, it can be very difficult to admit we are struggling.</p>\n<p>From a distance, it can seem as if others do not share in this struggle. They appear to make it look easy, seemingly relaxed and comfortable.</p>\n<p>I previously tried to ignore this stress and guilt. I threw myself into my work because I believed that being perfect at my job would mean less stress. I assumed that striving for perfection was the least stressful path.</p>\n<p>I gained valuable insight into how misguided this mindset was when I attended the Lee Hecht Harrison Elevating Women in Leadership (EWIL) workshop.</p>\n<p>There were so many incredible women in the room who, I knew by reputation, were amazing at their jobs. I recall thinking, &ldquo;I wonder what they will be able to get out of this workshop; surely they have this all figured out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What I learned was that we shared many of the same challenges, assumptions and fears. Hearing others&rsquo; stories allowed me to redefine my image of a leader.</p>\n<p>Before the EWIL workshop, I did not realize I carried a stereotype of a successful female leader. Trying to measure up to this ideal kept me from fully embracing my own style and was another needless source of stress. Seeing successful female leaders embrace their own authentic styles allowed me to shatter this stereotype and concern.</p>\n<p>I think we &nbsp;are slowly developing a different understanding of what &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; means. In the past, we believed leaders had to have all of the answers and drive all of the corporate results. How the work got done did not matter, so long as it got done.</p>\n<p>Today, it&rsquo;s all about networking. You don&rsquo;t need to have all of the answers. In fact, you shouldn&rsquo;t pretend that you have them all. But you do have to know where to go and who to connect with to get those answers. That&rsquo;s what makes a great leader.</p>\n<p>There are many different ways that women can demonstrate our unique value as leaders in today&rsquo;s business world. Work life used to be all about job security. Most people planned to stay with the same company for their entire careers.</p>\n<p>Today, people can and will change employers more frequently. That means companies have to work harder to keep their best employees and offer them much more than just job security. They need to provide a place where people want to show up for work day after day after day.</p>\n<p>Data tells us people join companies but leave managers. As women leaders, managing teams is an area of strength. Women are generally more intuitive and are, in many instances, able to make better, stronger connections with our employees. That builds loyalty.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this as a strength, rather than something that didn&rsquo;t fit my old &ldquo;leader stereotype&rdquo;, has given me more freedom to trust my own gut and lead my people in a way that feels authentic to me.</p>\n<p>To tap into the knowledge and experience of women, I recommend building your own community of female leaders simply by creating opportunities to share experiences with each other. It could be a group gathering or just finding one other woman at your company with whom you can speak candidly.</p>\n<p>Finding someone you feel comfortable sharing your fears and challenges with is a huge asset that can help you make sense of your own assumptions and find solutions to the roadblocks between you and success.</p>\n<p>One of the long-standing struggles I confronted at the EWIL workshop is a problem many women have: broadcasting our successes. Men don&rsquo;t usually have the same problem. They talk about their successes casually in conversation, over lunch or in the coffee room.</p>\n<p>Women, on the other hand, have this assumption that good work will speak for itself and that people will know when you&rsquo;ve done a good job. Often women are passed over for leadership opportunities simply because they do not promote their own past successes and future ambitions as well as men do. Instead, we are more likely to invest the time advocating for our colleagues.</p>\n<p>We all need to appreciate the differences in leadership, not just between men and women, but&nbsp; across the board. By being honest with ourselves and embracing our style, we can alleviate some of the unnecessary pressure we face and tap into the power of authenticity.</p>\n<p>In other words, we&rsquo;ll have one less &ldquo;stove left on&rdquo; in our lives.</p>",

      "description": "<p>In his notes to prepare for this interview, Kevin Connolly says he has the word &ldquo;people&rdquo; written everywhere. The President of Dell EMC Canada Commercial believes that building a culture around people and trust leads to exponential growth for an organization. Teams that trust each other will outperform those who don&rsquo;t. Trust should be developed and fostered by the organization.</p>\n<p>Connolly joined Dell EMC over a year ago via the company&rsquo;s acquisition of EMC, which eventually sent him north to Toronto from his hometown Chicago. I happened to be in Chicago the day of our interview, and spoke to Connolly about his advice for small businesses based on his experience from both sides of the border.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some of the biggest struggles that you see Canadian small business facing in their early days?</strong></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d say the biggest struggles for small companies are in building the culture. When you&rsquo;re hiring employee number one to employee number 30 there&rsquo;s the pressure of making sure that hire is right. You&rsquo;re setting the culture of a small community of people you have and making sure that they&rsquo;re inspired, and they see that as the business leader you&rsquo;re as invested as they are, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>If a small business can&rsquo;t set the right culture and inspire employees, then you may start to suffer attrition. You can imagine in a small business if you have people coming in the door and going back out six months later. That is probably the number one struggle I see, maintaining your employee base, keeping them inspired, staying consistent.</p>\n<p>Another struggle is that businesses think that the product will sell itself. That&rsquo;s a problem. It won&rsquo;t. Some businesses fall into this trap before realizing there&rsquo;s a lot more to it, like the importance of employee engagement. If you build an inspired and trusting culture that is consistent, you&rsquo;ll do really, really well.</p>\n<p><strong>Obviously, those early hires are super important. What can small businesses do to make sure they&rsquo;re hiring the right person so six months later someone doesn&rsquo;t walk out the door, as you said?</strong></p>\n<p>At Dell EMC, we&rsquo;re not a small business but we certainly approach it that way. First, I look for referrals. I think for anybody starting to build an organization, a great first step is to get people you trust to recommend you people that they trust.</p>\n<p>I would rather hire passionate energetic people and then teach them the business versus perhaps someone who&rsquo;s been in the industry a long time. There&rsquo;s certainly value in that, but when you&rsquo;re getting going and you&rsquo;re a small business&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard this a thousand times from small business owners&mdash;the amount of work needed to be done is massive and industry expertise isn&rsquo;t always what&rsquo;s needed, we need people to roll up their sleeves and get the job done, whatever that may be.</p>\n<p><strong>As a small business owner, you have to be in the trenches of the day-to-day making sure everything is getting done. How can they also stay focused on those more medium and long-term goals?</strong></p>\n<p>Success at the beginning begets being able to survive, right? You need to do a little bit of both.</p>\n<p>I learned from people running pretty successful small businesses, that as a business owner you have to enable the people that are running the business. There&rsquo;s so much to do long-term that getting sucked into the day-to-day isn&rsquo;t a winning strategy, they&rsquo;ve got to rely on people that they trust, and they&rsquo;ve hired. I think that it goes back to the people. You should put someone in charge and empower them.</p>\n<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to fail fast, and you&rsquo;ve got to take risks&mdash;calculated risks. Whether it&rsquo;s risk in hiring, jumping into another vertical market, putting additional money into marketing or trying a new social avenue. Whatever it might be, small businesses can learn through risk and failure.</p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s important that when small businesses realize a mistake was made, go ahead, admit that mistake, fail fast, and move on.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think the next big trend in technology is going to be and how will it impact the way that we work?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the future is more about what we&rsquo;re seeing today, just at hyper-scale. People are going to be mobile, people are going to be working from everywhere. Work will no longer be a place, it will be an activity, and I think devices are going to scale. My view of the world is it&rsquo;s just going to be continually mobile, continually easier from a sense that everything will be at our fingertips. The winner in the future will be the one consumers find easiest and most productive from an experience perspective. I think that&rsquo;s the race going on right now.</p>\n<p>I think personally that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m inspired at Dell EMC. We&rsquo;re building unique end-user technology that is making it easier to work on-the-go and to be more productive wherever you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the future of work is headed?</strong></p>\n<p>Data analytics and artificial intelligence&mdash;you hear these buzzwords a lot but it&rsquo;s truly real and it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re living every day. Data analytics and AI will look at what someone like you is doing in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Where are you at and what are you likely to do? And are you going to shop while you&rsquo;re there? You&rsquo;re going to have an advanced device and you&rsquo;re going to have all these companies mining through this type of data and finding ways to make your life easier or offer products, services and experiences all at a hyper-targeted level.</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you look to for mentorship?</strong></p>\n<p>Everybody should have a mentor, it&rsquo;s a great learning opportunity. I have a couple of mentors now. These are people that run global and multinational regions of businesses, operating in very complex situations that I think are fascinating. I have so much to learn.</p>\n<p>I look for global leaders that must deal with exchange rates and challenges in geopolitical issues and all the complexities that come with that.</p>\n<p>I would encourage anybody to go find someone who&rsquo;s dealing with as much complexity in an organization as you can and pick their brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, is there any advice you&rsquo;d want to give to an entrepreneur or a small business owner who&rsquo;s just starting out?</strong></p>\n<p>The amount of actual work it requires to make the small business successful is something that I&rsquo;ve often heard from small business owners and frankly, it&rsquo;s something that seems daunting to hear. They&rsquo;ve said to make sure you believe in it; make sure your heart is in it. It&rsquo;s going to be the hardest thing you&rsquo;ll ever do in your entire career. I&rsquo;ve heard that time and time again.</p>\n<p>If we&rsquo;re being honest with each other, it&rsquo;s scared me a couple times. Having worked with enough small businesses and watching some folks going through it, my advice would be, get ready for the tidal wave. It&rsquo;s an adventure but an exciting and rewarding one.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Over a three-year period, the District&rsquo;s Visioning Task Force designed a plan to activate student voices in the creation of new Vision, Mission, and Values Statements to inspire and guide our work as an educational organization. The Task Force comprised of Stakeholders, including seven students, parents, trustees, teachers, support staff, school and district administrators, and senior team. Our 21,000 elementary and secondary students were invited to share their stories, thoughts, images and artifacts from provocation questions such as &ldquo;If you had a crystal ball, what would you imagine school to be like in the future?&rdquo; &ldquo;How would you describe a great school to your younger brothers and sisters?&rdquo; &ldquo;What advice would you give trustees/superintendents/principals/teachers to enhance students&rsquo; learning and thinking?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The District collected videos, photos, and physical artifacts from our students and displayed them at a District-wide Caf&eacute;, Visioning Today for Tomorrow&rsquo;s World. Invited students, parents, stakeholders, and community members were excited to attend the Caf&eacute; to hear students&rsquo; stories, see students&rsquo; artifacts, and review students&rsquo; photos and videos as stimuli to identify key words, phrases and images to help develop the new District Vision, Mission and Value Statements. Check out this video of students sharing their inspirational insights and ideas during this process;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hMvobEcjttM\">https://youtu.be/hMvobEcjttM</a></p>\n<p>Once these three inspiring statements were approved by the Board of Education, a District-wide Poster Contest was launched to invite students in elementary and secondary schools to create a visual that represented the new vision statement.

          "textOnly": "<p>Over a three-year period, the District&rsquo;s Visioning Task Force designed a plan to activate student voices in the creation of new Vision, Mission, and Values Statements to inspire and guide our work as an educational organization. The Task Force comprised of Stakeholders, including seven students, parents, trustees, teachers, support staff, school and district administrators, and senior team. Our 21,000 elementary and secondary students were invited to share their stories, thoughts, images and artifacts from provocation questions such as &ldquo;If you had a crystal ball, what would you imagine school to be like in the future?&rdquo; &ldquo;How would you describe a great school to your younger brothers and sisters?&rdquo; &ldquo;What advice would you give trustees/superintendents/principals/teachers to enhance students&rsquo; learning and thinking?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The District collected videos, photos, and physical artifacts from our students and displayed them at a District-wide Caf&eacute;, Visioning Today for Tomorrow&rsquo;s World. Invited students, parents, stakeholders, and community members were excited to attend the Caf&eacute; to hear students&rsquo; stories, see students&rsquo; artifacts, and review students&rsquo; photos and videos as stimuli to identify key words, phrases and images to help develop the new District Vision, Mission and Value Statements. Check out this video of students sharing their inspirational insights and ideas during this process;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hMvobEcjttM\">https://youtu.be/hMvobEcjttM</a></p>\n<p>Once these three inspiring statements were approved by the Board of Education, a District-wide Poster Contest was launched to invite students in elementary and secondary schools to create a visual that represented the new vision statement. The Vision poster, comprised of the Vision, Mission, and Values Statements along with the winning visual, is now proudly displayed in every classroom, office, and public space throughout the Richmond School District. Furthermore, all members of the Richmond School District community have been invited to engage in regular discussions about these statements and to live them in our schools, workplaces and community.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/s7mMtshscAs\">https://youtu.be/s7mMtshscAs</a></p>\n<p>To signify our commitment to the new vision statement, &ldquo;the Richmond School District is the best place to learn and lead,&rdquo; the District piloted a number of leadership initiatives this Fall to enhance the creation of a district-wide leadership culture.

      "description": "<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you could read the body language of everybody in the meeting room to know if they are &ldquo;buyers and believers&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative and naysayers&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>How true is it that we can at all work out what others are thinking, feeling and intending toward us and our ideas from the behavior and body language we see from them?</p>\n<p>Can we trust our gut instincts? Can we trust the online articles we read? And can we trust the body language folklore that we grew up with? Let&rsquo;s look at some of the biggest myths around body language in the boardroom, and figure out a better way to think about the behaviors we see to give us an advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Crossing Arms = Closed for Business</strong></p>\n<p>We hear time and time again &ldquo;if they cross their arms, they are closed.&rdquo; And it follows for us in any meeting room, this can only mean one thing - the negotiation must be going south! Then how easy it is for us to catastrophize and then internally battle against those negative feelings, doubts and worries that arise at that moment. But how true is it that someone is feeling closed or negative toward us when their arms are crossed?</p>\n<p>Crossing the arms creates a physical barrier and closes off the body in what can look like a defensive posture, either intentionally or unconsciously blocking us off or closing us out. There are many reasons for arm crossing though: We are in a cold environment and so trying to keep the heat in; it is mid-afternoon and we are trying to keep ourselves more alert by holding the arms up higher on the body; we may be in an important meeting and concentrating hard by closing down other activity in the body to direct energy towards thinking; we are trying to remain in control; we are blocking out other unwanted stimuli.</p>\n<p>All of these reasons may make someone look closed, but, and this is the point, they may not actually be closed to us and our idea or point of view. Yes, they may be thinking carefully about it and focusing hard, and in the boardroom, particularly if we have alarm bells going off from some online article telling us to beware of crossed arms during meetings, this may look like it&rsquo;s game over. The truth is that crossed arms do not necessarily indicate that our listener is not interested or open to what we are saying or selling; however crossed arms will often trigger us into feeling that they are not, and in turn we are susceptible to behaving as if we believe them to be closed when in fact they may be anything but.</p>\n<p><strong>People Don't Have to Look to Listen</strong></p>\n<p>How many times have you heard someone say, &ldquo;I <em>am</em>listening. I may not be looking at you. But believe me, I&rsquo;m paying attention.&rdquo; Are they being disingenuous when they say that, or can people be truly listening to you even when they don&rsquo;t seem to be giving you their visual attention? Listening to everyday speech is about hearing and discovering potential meaning. If we are listening to poetry or written prose, we have the advantage of hearing in the written words more descriptors, words that create the mood and context. Not so in everyday speech, which uses far less vocabulary and far more repetition of the same words.</p>\n<p>So while they may be trying to give you their undivided attention but not actually looking at you, as meaning is helped along by seeing the words put into context, part of that context is of course nonverbal. To this point, someone may be unlikely to get the fullest meaning of what someone else is trying to communicate without taking in some of the nonverbal signals around their messaging. One way to get people&rsquo;s visual attention when speaking is not only to use more dynamic gestures that engage and help them to understand, but also include as you are speaking periodically ideas that subtly instruct the listener to look at you also. For example, &ldquo;you can look at it this way,&rdquo; &ldquo;see what I am saying here&rdquo; or &ldquo;visualize with me the picture around this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\"><strong>Nodding the Head Means Yes</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">It is very important for us, as social animals, to feel accepted by the group and also to accept others, to hold our groups together. While head nodding can show encouragement to others and indicate agreement, it can also be a signal of appeasement&mdash;placating someone&mdash;without necessarily agreeing with them. Head nodding is also quite often the result of isopraxism, the natural mirroring of another&rsquo;s behavior. In a group setting, it is sometimes both contagious and unconscious. Often those at the top of the social hierarchy can experience a room full of people nodding their heads at their idea and assume everyone agrees with them, only to discover later that no one accepted the idea or even understood it. And a completely still head can mean &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t accept it,&rdquo; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like it&rdquo; just as much as does shaking the head from side to side. In some cultures there is more emphasis put on always supporting up the hierarchy, which may explain why there may be great reports after some meetings of agreement and action items, and then nothing is followed up or carried out after the fact.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\"><strong>If They Are Breaking Eye Contact, They Are Being Deceptive</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">Eye avoidance is often wrongly associated with deception. But nothing could be further from the truth. Aldert Vrij, author of <em>Detecting Lies and Deceit: Pitfalls and Opportunities</em>&nbsp;found that people who habitually lie actually engage in greater eye contact. Why? Because they know people may be on the lookout for this behavior and they want to make sure we are buying their lie. A truthful person may, in fact, let their eyes wander off because they are not motivated to convince, only to convey a story.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">Eye aversion happens for many reasons, both personal and cultural. For instance, you may derive great personal comfort in recalling facts or an emotional experience by looking away from someone and looking down or focusing on something distant. Additionally, in some cultures and groups, it is instilled in children that when they are in front of authority, they should show respect by averting the eyes.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">In fact, deceit may not look at all how we think it is going to look. The confidence trickster does not so much engage in behaviors that display overt confidence as gain our confidence by offering something they can see we want. Often they do this by lowering their own status to give us what feels like an advantage. They give us a feeling of power. Therefore, don&rsquo;t expect a con artist to come to you looking like they have all the power. Rather, be aware of how your interaction with them may instill in you a sudden surge of powerful or superior feelings. Practiced con artists take advantage of our weaknesses around the power we may not possess but that we long for, and so manipulate feelings we may have of loneliness, insecurity or poor health; they also prey on our pride or simple ignorance.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">So in meetings where you need to be wary of falling victim to exaggeration or purposeful omissions, first understand the kind of lies that you may be most prone to believing in, either for personal reasons or on behalf of your organization. Only by having some perspective on your own insecurities or organizational anxieties that may be targets for deception can you best secure against them. So if you are offered the thing that feels like you just got the greatest deal on the thing you want most, pull back a moment and question it further and more fully.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">Finally, and this is NOT a myth:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\"><strong>Don't Read Them - Lead Them!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">It is much better to be in charge of the body language you are producing then to try to read the body language of others without the time and technique needed to properly critically examine the behaviors that you are seeing. Understand your own perspective, or lens, on the body language of others against the bigger context that they are in.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:-4.5pt;\">If you can, to find out more about this read our book <em>TRUTH &amp; LIES What People Are Really Thinking</em>. Concentrate on producing the best body language yourself for the outcomes you are after, and if you are clear and consistent with those signals, people will mirror you and follow your lead. Be warm and open with your body language, and people are more likely to be warm and open back to you. Conversely, be cold and closed, and you can expect that others will most likely be cold and closed toward you and your ideas. In the majority of our business situations, it is far better to concentrate on leading, not reading.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Smart audio is not something to focus on just because it was the big deal at CES this past January.</p>\n<p>The story is much bigger than that. We&rsquo;re starting to see data, insights and usage that reminds me of another magical moment in time: The early days of the commercialization of the Internet. That&rsquo;s what this is, and that&rsquo;s what this feels like. There is one big difference. As we sit here today, the devices have already gone mass market. Look no further than the data reported in The Smart Audio Report (Winter 2018) by Edison Research and NPR at CES:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><em>53 million people in the U.S. (18+) own a smart speaker (21%).</em></li>\n <li><em>14 million new smart speaker owners in 2018 alone.</em></li>\n <li><em>Number of smart speaker in U.S. households grew by 78% in just one year.</em></li>\n <li><em>During the 2018 holiday season 8% of people in the U.S. got a smart speaker.</em></li>\n <li><em>29% use their smart speaker several times a day.</em></li>\n <li><em>People have these devices. They are everywhere, and that is expanding as well.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pushing beyond The Smart Audio Report&rsquo;s most recent data, Google has been very vocal as well. In a January blog post (Here&rsquo;s how the Google Assistant became more helpful in 2018), the company stated that Google Assistant grew four times over the past year. And, &ldquo;by the end of this month, we expect the Google Assistant to be available on one billion devices, up from 500 million last May.&rdquo; One billion devices will have Google Assistant&rsquo;s voice functionality. In a word: staggering. It&rsquo;s not just smartphones and smart speakers. On the Amazon front, people are looking forward to welcoming Alexa and the interactive voice skills that go along with it in the car as well. When Amazon launched Echo Auto (by invitation only), they may not have been prepared for the one million-plus preorders that are about to ship. With that, Amazon also announced that it has sold more than 100 million devices with Alexa.</p>\n<p>More devices and much more demand.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where the state of smart audio sits. The devices are plentiful and filling up our homes, cars and available in smartphones. The battle for voice rages on, while businesses need to rethink everything about their digital presence and how to connect with consumers. With this technology comes new realities. Take a look through the Media Village article, Voice Search Is Replacing Keyword Data, to better understand the massive impact and disruption this will cause for your business and marketing:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As more people buy voice-enabled devices, adoption of voice search is set to rise with some even predicting that it will replace text as the primary means of searching &ndash; like how smartphones overtook desktop&hellip; If the predictions are true, then we should expect that 30-50% of searches (Gartner and comScore) will be through voice. Paired with this new revelation, this could mean up to half of all keywords won&rsquo;t contain an entity, thus eroding the insightfulness that keywords and their search volumes yield to brands and their marketing intelligence. Searches provide brands with insight into seasonality for budget pacing, color nuances for designing products and market research, to name just a few examples. Keywords have long been a staple of intelligence for brands, but their significance and level of detail has lessened over the years. Positively, brands should be focusing on their audiences&rsquo; &lsquo;needs&rsquo; instead of vein metrics like traffic. Without keywords being as effective for audience insight, brands will need to find intelligence elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Adoption is one thing. Being mainstream is another. Now, what smart audio really needs is for people to get beyond the one-and-done (use it for a bit, and only for a few things then wane) over to it being a critical part of how we live, work and operate with technology (which seems to be the direction that it should be flowing towards). What (should) happen today (and beyond) is a demonstration from both Google and Amazon that smart audio is not a one (or five trick) pony. Both brands (and Apple and Samsung can&rsquo;t be dismissed in the smart audio space &ndash; plus where is Microsoft's Cortana in all of this?) need to demonstrate that the depth and breadth of new capabilities and uses that smart audio can (and will) provide consumers going forward will be boundless. Amazon and Google also need to address the myriad of privacy and security concerns that people have about these devices constantly &ldquo;listening&rdquo; in on their lives. What is being recorded?

          "textOnly": "<p>Smart audio is not something to focus on just because it was the big deal at CES this past January.</p>\n<p>The story is much bigger than that. We&rsquo;re starting to see data, insights and usage that reminds me of another magical moment in time: The early days of the commercialization of the Internet. That&rsquo;s what this is, and that&rsquo;s what this feels like. There is one big difference. As we sit here today, the devices have already gone mass market. Look no further than the data reported in The Smart Audio Report (Winter 2018) by Edison Research and NPR at CES:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><em>53 million people in the U.S. (18+) own a smart speaker (21%).</em></li>\n <li><em>14 million new smart speaker owners in 2018 alone.</em></li>\n <li><em>Number of smart speaker in U.S. households grew by 78% in just one year.</em></li>\n <li><em>During the 2018 holiday season 8% of people in the U.S. got a smart speaker.</em></li>\n <li><em>29% use their smart speaker several times a day.</em></li>\n <li><em>People have these devices. They are everywhere, and that is expanding as well.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pushing beyond The Smart Audio Report&rsquo;s most recent data, Google has been very vocal as well. In a January blog post (Here&rsquo;s how the Google Assistant became more helpful in 2018), the company stated that Google Assistant grew four times over the past year. And, &ldquo;by the end of this month, we expect the Google Assistant to be available on one billion devices, up from 500 million last May.&rdquo; One billion devices will have Google Assistant&rsquo;s voice functionality. In a word: staggering. It&rsquo;s not just smartphones and smart speakers. On the Amazon front, people are looking forward to welcoming Alexa and the interactive voice skills that go along with it in the car as well. When Amazon launched Echo Auto (by invitation only), they may not have been prepared for the one million-plus preorders that are about to ship. With that, Amazon also announced that it has sold more than 100 million devices with Alexa.</p>\n<p>More devices and much more demand.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where the state of smart audio sits. The devices are plentiful and filling up our homes, cars and available in smartphones. The battle for voice rages on, while businesses need to rethink everything about their digital presence and how to connect with consumers. With this technology comes new realities. Take a look through the Media Village article, Voice Search Is Replacing Keyword Data, to better understand the massive impact and disruption this will cause for your business and marketing:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As more people buy voice-enabled devices, adoption of voice search is set to rise with some even predicting that it will replace text as the primary means of searching &ndash; like how smartphones overtook desktop&hellip; If the predictions are true, then we should expect that 30-50% of searches (Gartner and comScore) will be through voice. Paired with this new revelation, this could mean up to half of all keywords won&rsquo;t contain an entity, thus eroding the insightfulness that keywords and their search volumes yield to brands and their marketing intelligence. Searches provide brands with insight into seasonality for budget pacing, color nuances for designing products and market research, to name just a few examples. Keywords have long been a staple of intelligence for brands, but their significance and level of detail has lessened over the years. Positively, brands should be focusing on their audiences&rsquo; &lsquo;needs&rsquo; instead of vein metrics like traffic. Without keywords being as effective for audience insight, brands will need to find intelligence elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Adoption is one thing. Being mainstream is another. Now, what smart audio really needs is for people to get beyond the one-and-done (use it for a bit, and only for a few things then wane) over to it being a critical part of how we live, work and operate with technology (which seems to be the direction that it should be flowing towards). What (should) happen today (and beyond) is a demonstration from both Google and Amazon that smart audio is not a one (or five trick) pony. Both brands (and Apple and Samsung can&rsquo;t be dismissed in the smart audio space &ndash; plus where is Microsoft's Cortana in all of this?) need to demonstrate that the depth and breadth of new capabilities and uses that smart audio can (and will) provide consumers going forward will be boundless. Amazon and Google also need to address the myriad of privacy and security concerns that people have about these devices constantly &ldquo;listening&rdquo; in on their lives. What is being recorded? What is being done with this data? How can consumers have all of the control over their data versus being a victim to it?</p>\n<p>The big reason why smart audio is what&rsquo;s next&hellip; and what&rsquo;s now:</p>\n<p>Typing and writing will be relegated to those that are writing something. Audio is the best user interface. It&rsquo;s the way humans communicate. We will (in the not-to-distant future) communicate with (and through) technology with voice (and voice only). This is early days. Think back to those first web browsers, dial-up connectivity and earlier websites. Messy, clunky, not obvious, etc&hellip; Smart audio is only a few steps ahead of this because the technology is becoming such a crucial function of smartphones and the demand of smart speakers in the current market. It&rsquo;s happening. It&rsquo;s important.</p>\n<p>Your brand voice strategy. It&rsquo;s about much more than what it sounds like.</p>"

      "description": "<p>Malala Yousafzai is many things. The survivor of a Taliban assassination attempt. An activist for female rights and education. She is a fighter and a crusader for justice. But Malala is also a leader, despite her young age. Her mission is to remind us that leadership is about the willingness to speak for yourself and for others. Malala believes in the magic that happens when you believe in yourself and the magic of your voice. Though this magic, she says, women will feel empowered. She speaks of the need for women to not become complacent. She wants them to become leaders themselves. She also wants women to appreciate and celebrate what we have in common. &ldquo;We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a potent message. Malala Yousafzai is a leader with the courage and determination to change the world.</p>\n<p>Malala grew up in the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan. Malala&rsquo;s father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, was a passionate education advocate who helped run a learning institution in the city. School and education played a big role in Malala&rsquo;s early life. In 2007, when Malala was ten years old, the situation in the Swat Valley changed. The Taliban moved into the area and quickly became the dominant voice throughout much of northwestern Pakistan. Girls were banned from attending school, and cultural activities like dancing and watching television became verboten. Suicide attacks were widespread, and the Taliban made its opposition to female education a cornerstone of its terror campaign. By the end of 2008, the Taliban had destroyed some 400 schools. But this never stopped Malala from speaking out for the rights of girls and women, not just in her home country of Pakistan but across the globe. Malala believed, &ldquo;If one man can destroy everything, why can't one girl change it?&rdquo; Even at such an incredibly young age, Malala refused to let the Taliban stifle her courage. &ldquo;There was fear, but I never let that fear overcome my courage. I let my courage win,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p>To bring about change, leaders instinctively understand they can&rsquo;t wait for change to happen. To make change they have to make it happen themselves. Malala was determined to go to school. She believed in her right to an education. She openly criticized the Taliban on Pakistani TV, calling them out for taking away her basic right to an education. In early 2009, Malala started to blog anonymously. At 11 years of age, she began to write for the BBC in a diary describing her life and being afraid to go to school. Even now Malala says, &ldquo;Let us pick up our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That same year, Malala was forced to leave her home and seek safety hundreds of miles away. Upon her return to Swat, she continued her public campaign for her right to go to school. As her voice grew louder, her magic as a leader became more powerful. Word spread about Malala and her father. They became known throughout Pakistan for their determination and insistence that Pakistani girls get immediate access to a free quality education. She was nominated for the International Children&rsquo;s Peace Prize in 2011. That same year, she was awarded Pakistan&rsquo;s National Youth Peace Prize. With her growing activism, it was just a question of time before the Taliban showed their hand.</p>\n<p>In 2012, on a bus with her friends, having finished school exams, Malala was shot in the head, the target in an assassination attempt by the Taliban. Malala survived the attack and was airlifted to Birmingham in Great Britain for care and rehabilitation. Throughout her ordeal, Malala insisted that conflict and violence were not the answer. Said Malala, &ldquo;I don't want revenge on the Taliban, I want education for sons and daughters of the Taliban.&rdquo; Malala didn&rsquo;t want to be thought of as the girl who was shot by the Taliban, she wanted to the world to see her as the girl who fought for education. Instead of stopping her, she became even more determined to make her life&rsquo;s work helping girls and women empower their lives through education and equality.</p>\n<p>Malala spoke at the United Nations on her 16th Birthday, calling for education accessibility. &ldquo;I told myself, Malala, you have already faced death. This is your second life. Don't be afraid - if you are afraid, you can't move forward.&rdquo; Although she was only a teenager, Malala showed the world what leadership really means. Leadership isn't about titles, recognition or corporate power. Leadership is about standing up for positive change. It&rsquo;s about taking risks, even in the face of fear. Leadership is about doing the right thing. Malala showed the world that leaders need to be brave and that the brave are the people who fight for what is fair without limitations.</p>\n<p>Later that year, she published her first book, an autobiography entitled &ldquo;I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban&rdquo; and won the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. In 2014, Malala and her father co-founded the Malala Fund, an organization that, through education, empowers girls to achieve their potential and become confident and strong leaders in their own countries.</p>\n<p>Today, Malala continues to use her leader&rsquo;s voice to advocate for girls and women&rsquo;s rights. With more than 130 million girls out of school, Malala continues to work her magic. She travels far and wide getting the message out there as she fights poverty, wars, child marriage, and gender discrimination to go to school. &ldquo;There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a third power stronger than both, that of women.&rdquo; Malala is one leader who is making sure that their stories, like hers, continue to be heard around the world.</p>",

      "description": "<p>We spend vast sums of money, in the corporate world, on training and&nbsp;developing our leaders&mdash;in the United States alone, a jaw-dropping $14 billion every year.&nbsp;The usual leadership course goes something like this: There&rsquo;s a video, either of people talking about leaders, or else of a real leader in the real world. It&rsquo;s intriguing, provocative, and moving. We learn about the impact leaders have had on the various interview subjects, or we feel it ourselves as we see the real leader on-screen. While watching, we feel inspired, curious, energized&mdash;that we are going to learn about something important, and that we have just, in a small way, felt that important thing for ourselves.</p>\n<p>Then a facilitator steps to the front of the room and explains&nbsp;the model. The model takes whatever we&rsquo;ve just seen and experienced and makes it boring. The model is usually a two-by-two grid of little boxes, and in each of the boxes is written some sort of abstract word:&nbsp;empathy,&nbsp;authenticity,&nbsp;vision, and so forth. And then the facilitator explains that for the next several hours of our lives, we will take each little box in turn, and learn about the abstract thing written in it, and how each of us can have more of that thing. Sometimes the course has been preceded by an assessment that we&rsquo;ve all taken, and partway through the course we get to see our results, and how we compare with the things in the boxes. Sometimes we get to give one another feedback in real time at our tables on how we&rsquo;re doing at the things in the boxes. Sometimes we build action plans and write down in our notebooks well-meaning commitments about how we&rsquo;ll do more of the things in boxes, knowing as we do so that the moment the course finishes, these commitments will join &ldquo;floss more often&rdquo; in the&nbsp;Big Lifetime Pile&nbsp;Of Things Not Done.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re told, as we do all these things, that at the end of this process,&nbsp;we will all be more like the leader we saw at the beginning. But our&nbsp;experience, as we go along, is one of increasing frustration. None of the&nbsp;things in the boxes helps us locate the feeling we had, in the opening&nbsp;video, about a particular leader. Indeed, the things in the boxes seem&nbsp;to have nothing on earth to do with the actual leader we&rsquo;ve seen, or any&nbsp;actual leaders we&rsquo;ve seen. We encounter leaders, in life, emotionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;In our leadership training, the first thing we do&mdash;in our attempt to&nbsp;understand leadership&mdash;is to wring the emotional life out of the thing.</p>\n<p>Because what never, ever happens in any of these courses is our&nbsp;starting with the question: who are you? Not, who are you in comparison with some model involving abstract words in little boxes, but&nbsp;who are you as a living, breathing, growing, worrying, joyous, uncertain, loving, striving, messy, and yes, spiky human being? We never&nbsp;ask why, given your particular jumble of characteristics, anyone would follow you. We never ask how&mdash;given that one-of-a-kind mixture of&nbsp;&nbsp;states and traits that makes you who you are&mdash;you would use those&nbsp;things to create an experience for the people around you, and use&nbsp;what you have to help them feel better about the world you&rsquo;re all walking through together, and, while we&rsquo;re at it, how we might give you&nbsp;some measure of that so you can adjust your course as you go.</p>\n<p>So we need to stop with the models. Stop with the 360-degree&nbsp;assessments. Stop with the minute and meaningless parsing of how to&nbsp;move your &ldquo;effective communications&rdquo; score from a 3.8 to a 3.9, while&nbsp;also figuring out why your peers gave you a 4.1 on &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; yet your&nbsp;boss gave you a 3.0. Stop with the endless lists of abstractions. Stop&nbsp;debating whether it&rsquo;s authenticity or tribal leadership or situational&nbsp;leadership or level-five leadership or whatever the latest leadership-nirvana thing is. Stop with the one-size-fits-all.</p>\n<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s get humble&mdash;the experience of the people on our teams and in our organizations is a true thing, and we don&rsquo;t simply get to choose what it is.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get curious about that experience and how our actions shape it.</p>\n<p>And let&rsquo;s follow our own reactions to real people in the real world. When we feel uplifted by what someone does or says, we need to stop and ask why. When we feel a fresh rush of energy after talking with someone, we need to stop and ask why. When we feel, in response to another human being, that mysterious attraction tugging on us&mdash;like a fish on a line, or like a needle twitching in a compass, an attraction that says... here, something is happening, something true and visceral and substantial, something that will change, however slightly, the arc of our future&mdash;we need to stop and ask why.</p>\n<p>We need to get to know real leaders in the real world, and we need to come to know them as followers ourselves.

Stop with the one-size-fits-all.</p>\n<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s get humble&mdash;the experience of the people on our teams and in our organizations is a true thing, and we don&rsquo;t simply get to choose what it is.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get curious about that experience and how our actions shape it.</p>\n<p>And let&rsquo;s follow our own reactions to real people in the real world. When we feel uplifted by what someone does or says, we need to stop and ask why. When we feel a fresh rush of energy after talking with someone, we need to stop and ask why. When we feel, in response to another human being, that mysterious attraction tugging on us&mdash;like a fish on a line, or like a needle twitching in a compass, an attraction that says... here, something is happening, something true and visceral and substantial, something that will change, however slightly, the arc of our future&mdash;we need to stop and ask why.</p>\n<p>We need to get to know real leaders in the real world, and we need to come to know them as followers ourselves. Then we can start&nbsp;learning.</p>"

I knew my story was not just mine. It was the story of millions of people around the world who continue to suffer in silence due to a lack of support, awareness, and hope. I wanted to give people that hope. I wanted to raise my voice and help others reclaim their voices. I wanted to break the silence for the millions of silences that are still waiting to be broken.</p>\n<p>The same questions arise in my mind each time I go on stage, as I publish my book, even as I write this piece.

My friends who watched my kids when I went to class or court, and who showed up with ice cream to drown my sorrows after a bad day. My professors who spent hours motivating me to believe in myself. My mentors who helped me with critical decisions in my life. By having faith in me, these people taught me to have faith in myself.

A sense of belonging. A community of support. For human connection creates incredible resilience.</p>\n<p>The tough part, though, is getting there. In order to create connection, we must allow ourselves to be seen. Really seen. We must practice letting go of who we think we are supposed to be, and embrace who we truly are, by cultivating the courage to be imperfect and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable. And that is scary. Many of us live in self-made prisons of judgment, with the key held by strangers from whom we seek approval.</p>\n<p>When my Toronto Life article went viral, I had massive anxiety going back to work the following week, unsure of how my story would be perceived in a corporate environment at a major bank. But as I walked through the office, colleagues who I&rsquo;d barely ever spoken with came up and gave me teary hugs, sharing their own life stories and experiences. This has resulted in genuine, life-long friendships and connections that go beyond our job titles and business cards. I cherish these connections every day.</p>\n<p>When we connect from a place of humanity, what fades into the background is where we were born, the colour of our skin, the gender we identify with, the faith we practice, or who we choose to love. Because when we connect authentically, we realize that what unites us is far greater and more powerful than what divides us. By practicing the courage to show up as who we are, we give others around us permission to do the same, building trust and confidence, a common sense of values, and the emotional muscle to allow ourselves to fail and to empower each other to get back up. We realize a profound thing: We do not have to do it alone, because we are not meant to do it alone. We create collective resilience in ourselves, our families, our teams, and our workplaces.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a major part of my life hiding pieces of myself from others in order to fit in. As a girl who was told her dreams were too big, as a woman who was trying impossibly to perch on the pedestal of being &ldquo;a good wife&rdquo;, and as a person who was seen by many as a source of shame or as a threat to their own value systems, I&rsquo;ve tried to hide my imperfections behind my awards and accomplishments, seeking validation of my worth in others&rsquo; approval. I&rsquo;ve learned that the only person I need that approval from is myself. The vulnerability of my truth does not diminish me.

Other times new products simply add joy and beauty to a routine activity, just as Method did when it gave pump soap a contemporary makeover.&nbsp; And sometimes, breakthrough products create brand-new behavior the way Fitbit did when it made it a social norm to count steps.</p>\n<p>So how are these ideas born? How do people who are not professional designers get started?</p>\n<p>During my years working at Playskool, a trial attorney friend told me he could never do my job, saying, &ldquo;Sitting down to face a blank screen or piece of paper every day would scare the crap out of me. How do you make something from nothing? Where do you get your ideas?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He envisioned my workday as a mysterious process of actively seeking stop-in-your-tracks lightning bolt inspirations. I told him I could never imagine succeeding in&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;job, which I simplified down to &ldquo;getting paid to argue in front of strangers all day.&rdquo; I told my friend that when you are employed to generate good ideas, you develop a definitive and predictable process for being creative. Today people call that process &ldquo;design thinking.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I will save you the trouble of researching design thinking as an abstract concept and boil it down to its basic process:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITY:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>What is the business or customer area that needs attention? In the case of Fitbit, the founders James Park and Eric Friedman saw an opportunity to help people improve their fitness with newfound access to individualized performance data. This breakthrough was made possible because of the advent of new cost- effective miniaturized sensors.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>SETTING GOALS AND CONSTRAINTS:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Setting goals for a new product is an iterative process as the entrepreneur learns more via research. But a product like Fitbit could start with a list such as: &ldquo;This solution must cost less than $100. It has to be convenient to carry at all times. It must be water resistant. It must not interfere with normal daily activities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>RESEARCH:</strong></p>\n<p>Research involves studying the three Cs: customers, competition, and (internal) capabilities. For Fitbit, the potential customer need was fairly vast: people who want to set and meet fitness goals. Investigation at the time of Fitbit&rsquo;s founding in 2007 would have yielded very little relevant competition, as existing solutions were cumbersome and required a customer to manually stitch together data from devices such as a pedometer, heartrate monitor, or calorie counter.&nbsp;Beyond technology advances, the founders could easily see that people were increasingly drawn to online communities and the gamification of ordinary activities&mdash;a big trend to draft off.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>IDEATION:</strong></p>\n<p>This involves conceiving and quickly visualizing various concepts (you often see a ream of exciting raw sketches highlighted in the visual history of a product). Some founders draw their own concepts, while others engage a designer at this stage, but fancy renderings are not advised at such an early step. The original Fitbit was a thumb- sized clip, but it is likely that all manner of devices were conceived&mdash;ranging from necklaces, bracelets, credit card-sized devices to fit in a wallet, shoe inserts, and the like. Even if many of these ideas were not technically or economically feasible, the goal during ideation is to cast as wide a net as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ROUGH PROTOTYPING AND FEEDBACK:</strong></p>\n<p>Rapidly prototyping concepts to get customer feedback comes next. Early stage prototyping for a device like the Fitbit could be as simple as a nonfunctional foam version of a clip presented alongside a static set of graphic screenshots to show the type of data the device could collect. Early prototypes help express the idea to a potential user without needing to be fully functional. Fitbit would have been looking for feedback on core interest in these new capabilities, as much as for feedback on form and function.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ADVANCED PROTOTYPES:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The entrepreneur repeats the last two steps enough times to commit to testable prototypes that help her lock down on a single idea. Advanced prototypes usually look like the real deal, even if they are not fully functional. But the more functional, the better.</p>\n<p>There is nothing in that process that requires long walks on the beach, consuming hallucinogenics, or locking yourself in a dim room with Mozart playing. It&rsquo;s a rigorous and disciplined process you can do right in the middle of a fluorescent-lit office, or in your kitchen, or at a coffee shop. Anytime, anywhere.</p>\n<p>There are two deep secrets to this process. Success lies not just in a designer&rsquo;s ability to generate concepts. First, great ideas are entirely hostage to the information and stimulation the designer (or aspiring Maker) gathers to provoke their gestation. In other words, it&rsquo;s all about the goals and research. You can think of this almost like cooking. The better the ingredients, the better the food. Ideas need to be fueled by great inputs.</p>\n<p>For example, I was part of a consulting firm team that engineered the famous Reebok Pump shoe, which allowed a user to inflate an internal chamber for cushioning and support purposes.</p>\n<p>After its wild success we were subsequently engaged to propose ideas for shoes that could help a person jump higher. The research project included a huge range of athlete interviews and observations and then exploration of springy or reactive materials, mechanical systems, and natural systems. It even included the study of what enables the best rebounders on Earth&mdash;fleas&mdash;to jump 100 times their body height. (That would be like a person jumping over the Eiffel Tower.) Only after that wide-ranging exploration did our engineer, Eric Cohen, sit down and start sketching ideas.</p>\n<p>The second critical building block to generating successful ideas actually precedes the research described above. As Eric explains it: &ldquo;The first step is to define the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve very clearly. The Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen calls this &lsquo;the job to be done.&rsquo; This clarity then narrows down the field of possible solutions and brainstorming activities. If you just start brainstorming, you lack context for deciding which concepts are best. If you can clearly articulate the problem, often the solutions seem to magically appear and become obvious. But getting to that point of clarity is the real challenge.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the case of step one, &ldquo;identifying opportunity,&rdquo; Grommet Makers do not approach this step like an established business would. Why? Because they don&rsquo;t have an actual business just yet. They aren&rsquo;t noticing sales slipping, doing heavy R&amp;D that yields opportunity, or responding to competitive threats. They are just going about their lives. As such, they tend to stumble into either (1) a problem that vexes them and needs solving or (2) an emerging technology or behavior that inspires them.</p>\n<p>In fact, only 10 percent of Grommet Makers have any professional experience in the area where they end up building a product. In an interesting parallel, in my capacity as an entrepreneur in residence at Harvard Business School, I observe that a great number of the students pursue the well-known degree and credential as a giant, and admittedly expensive, career reset button. Makers often experience their businesses in much the same way. They throw over or work out of established careers to pursue an idea. The business is going to be epic in terms of effort and opportunity cost compared to other easier ways they might have collected a salary. But the idea becomes an itch that must be scratched, whatever the cost. The idea is often the fuel for all of the late nights, financial sacrifice, and occasional skepticism of friends and family.</p>",

The Honest Company mastered this structure with three formal elements:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><strong>Context</strong><em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>The current social and economic conditions, existing product portfolio, competitive landscape, and corporate culture.</li>\n <li><strong>Combination</strong><em>&nbsp;&ndash;</em>&nbsp;The act of selecting key actions that can positively influence actions when done together.</li>\n <li><strong>Sequence</strong><em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</em>The act of establishing a priority, order and timing to those actions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For her<strong>&nbsp;</strong>context, Alba, in dealing with her own family&rsquo;s needs, had in fact identified an emerging &ndash; and huge -- new market. Consumer attitudes were changing everywhere in the world regarding the purity of household products. The big consumer companies were beginning to notice &ndash; but only a start-up like The Honest Company was willing to risk going all the way in and committing the company wholly to natural products. A timely move considering that a recent report by market watcher The Nielsen Company found that &ldquo;Forty-two percent of global respondents say they&rsquo;re willing to pay a premium for products made with organic or all-natural ingredients.&rdquo;&nbsp; How big of a global market? $60 billion is the most recent estimate.

Alba didn&rsquo;t just launch a strategy but selected the right one by understanding the marketplace first.</p>\n<p>For her&nbsp;combination, The Honest Company made a breathtaking series of moves instead of just one&mdash;all in only half a decade. With its initial focus on diapers, infant formulas and baby cleaning products it quickly expanded its sales to its initial group of prosperous and demanding mothers (customer base penetration). Then it added a subscription program for diapers and wipes (product expansion). Meanwhile, it took the unlikely path of selling its products solely on-line and making major donations to charities from Day One (unconventional strategies). Then it reversed direction and added off-line retailing through CVS, Whole Foods and other chains (customer base penetration). It moved into women&rsquo;s beauty products (more customer base penetration).

      "description": "<p>A sales leader asked us last week if we had found anything in our research that contradicts long-held wisdom about leadership? Yes, we said, there have been ahas in our work that should change the way we all think about the science of leading others. For instance,</p>\n<p><strong>Myth 1: You should treat everyone equally.</strong></p>\n<p>Conventional wisdom has been that you should treat all members of your team the same because that assures fair management. With all due respect:&nbsp;Bwahaha! That is old school thinking, and it prevents leaders from optimizing the allocation of responsibilities among team members according to their particular motivations and abilities. Career development, for instance, is going to be very different for an employee who wants to climb the corporate ladder versus one who simply wants to do a good job and go home at five. Both employees are important to your team and, trust us, both want to be developed&mdash;career development has replaced pay as the number one reason people leave an organization&mdash;but each needs to be developed in very different ways. This process doesn&rsquo;t have to take a huge bite out of a manager&rsquo;s time. Many team leaders use something we call job sculpting&mdash;having frequent, brief aspirational conversations with each of their people to review progress on development goals and career growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth 2: Money is not a motivator.</strong></p>\n<p>Says who? Yes, we&rsquo;ve read the research around this subject&mdash;often conducted with college students incented or not incented to do a specific task. It&rsquo;s fun reading but should never influence how a real manager runs a real team. Have you ever worked in sales, or ever known anyone who has? Is money important to people who are commission-based? You&rsquo;d better believe it. Have you ever been underpaid in a job? Did you stay long in that job? What our research on money shows is twofold: First, money is actually a very strong motivator for about 10 percent of the human population. Admittedly, that&rsquo;s not a huge percentage, but for those people money is a very big driver and there&rsquo;s a chance you have someone on your team who fits that bill. And the good news: You know exactly how to get those people to focus on their goals. Second, money for the majority of the rest of us may not be a strong motivator, but it&rsquo;s still a&nbsp;satisfier&mdash;meaning if we don&rsquo;t make enough to pay the rent, feed our families, or feel commensurately rewarded for our contributions, then we either won&rsquo;t stay long or will stay and be dissatisfied in our work. But once most of us cross a threshold with money (and are making enough to meet our core needs), then other factors become much more important in motivating us day-to-day.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth 3: Autonomy is a core motivator.</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most striking findings from our research is that while autonomy is one of the strongest motivators for Boomers and Gen X workers, it ranks near the bottom for Millennials and Gen Z. As one young worker told us in an interview, &ldquo;Why would I want to work autonomously? That&rsquo;s terrifying.&rdquo; Our research shows that most younger workers want much more coaching and mentoring from their managers than previous generations, and the majority value working in a team versus working on their own work. That, alone, should be changing the way we think about leading our teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth 4: Intrinsic motivation is more important than extrinsic.</strong></p>\n<p>Psychologists such as Frederick Herzberg and Edward Deci explained that extrinsic motivation can actually have a negative influence on knowledge workers and productive people are almost exclusively&nbsp;intrinsically&nbsp;motivated. Our latest research shows&nbsp;individual&nbsp;motivation is much more complicated and understanding how varied we all are is crucial to figuring out why one particular person might be unhappy or not as engaged as he could be at work. In two decades of diving deep into the subjects of employee engagement and team performance with Fortune 500 clients, we&rsquo;ve found that even employees who are intrinsically driven can be very unhappy. For instance, we've been asked to work with a bevy of health care firms that have high turnover and strong disenchantment in staff and clinical areas. And often&nbsp;physicians&nbsp;are those with the greatest discontent (certainly a group that, as a whole, are intrinsically driven). Why are so many of them miserable? Their number one complaint by a country mile: Compensation. It seems intrinsic motivation is not the whole story, and extrinsic motivation isn&rsquo;t all bad. Now, with that said about our doctor friends, one key failing in many previous studies is that they mistakenly suppose the only extrinsic motivator leaders use is monetary rewards, ignoring the positive effects of praise, promotion, leadership attention, the admiration of peers, and so on. We personally have been told by hundreds of employees around the world some variation of what a young professional woman told us recently: &ldquo;Two years ago my CEO sent me an awesome thank you note. When things get tough I pull that note out and read it. It still reenergizes me.&rdquo; We have found intrinsic and extrinsic motivators are not diametrically opposed, they are not good and evil. To feel the most highly motivated, most employees must have some of both&mdash;in a balance that is most motivating to them.</p>",

It isn&rsquo;t always easy, but it&rsquo;s real. Once we accept that everyone has their own struggle, we can have greater self-acceptance and compassion for ourselves and our own journey.</p>\n<p><strong>Live your truth and let yourself show up as you really are.</strong></p>\n<p>Living your most fulfilled life means being true to yourself and allowing yourself to be seen &ndash; vulnerability and all. Often, this requires letting go of what others have told us about ourselves. If you&rsquo;re one of those people, like I was, it will mean having the courage to press pause and shut out the external messages to discover who you truly are.</p>\n<p>Getting honest with yourself is the first step to living your best life. This is easier said than done, because it means sharing your authentic self (and work) with the world.</p>\n<p>If we never get comfortable with being uncomfortable, it becomes impossible to grow and step into our potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Invest in daily rituals that help you maintain consistent levels of happiness.</strong></p>\n<p>Our level of happiness is based on how steadily the state of happiness occurs in our lives, as opposed to how many happiness &lsquo;peaks&rsquo; we experience. When you&rsquo;re working towards a big goal, it can be an incredible rush when you succeed, and you&rsquo;ll probably experience a happiness &lsquo;peak&rsquo;. However, when the moment is gone, so is the peak of happiness, and you can end up feeling let down.</p>\n<p>Rather than putting all of our energy on milestones or possessions that we think will make us happy, we can choose to invest in daily, regular commitments to ourselves, our loved ones and our goals. Not only will this help level-set after trauma or success, it will help us maintain consistent happiness throughout our lives.</p>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s getting more rest, connecting with nature, meditating, spending time with people you care about or just treating yourself, do what makes you feel well every day. Something that I know helps me is practicing gratitude. Whether it&rsquo;s for yourself or for other people, gratitude connects us to the abundance we already have.</p>\n<p>It took me awhile to come to a place of acceptance and responsibility, but I&rsquo;m so grateful that I have. Every area of my life has benefitted by playing the long game and focussing on maintaining consistent happiness and not chasing the next peak. I know that these practices will help me to stay true to my values, no matter what, and live a life well lived. This is what happiness is to me.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability, taking responsibility for your own life and being mindful are the qualities that will support us all in living our best life &mdash; and when we live our best life, happiness will be quick to follow.</p>",

This is easier said than done, because it means sharing your authentic self (and work) with the world.</p>\n<p>If we never get comfortable with being uncomfortable, it becomes impossible to grow and step into our potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Invest in daily rituals that help you maintain consistent levels of happiness.</strong></p>\n<p>Our level of happiness is based on how steadily the state of happiness occurs in our lives, as opposed to how many happiness &lsquo;peaks&rsquo; we experience. When you&rsquo;re working towards a big goal, it can be an incredible rush when you succeed, and you&rsquo;ll probably experience a happiness &lsquo;peak&rsquo;. However, when the moment is gone, so is the peak of happiness, and you can end up feeling let down.</p>\n<p>Rather than putting all of our energy on milestones or possessions that we think will make us happy, we can choose to invest in daily, regular commitments to ourselves, our loved ones and our goals. Not only will this help level-set after trauma or success, it will help us maintain consistent happiness throughout our lives.</p>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s getting more rest, connecting with nature, meditating, spending time with people you care about or just treating yourself, do what makes you feel well every day. Something that I know helps me is practicing gratitude. Whether it&rsquo;s for yourself or for other people, gratitude connects us to the abundance we already have.</p>\n<p>It took me awhile to come to a place of acceptance and responsibility, but I&rsquo;m so grateful that I have. Every area of my life has benefitted by playing the long game and focussing on maintaining consistent happiness and not chasing the next peak. I know that these practices will help me to stay true to my values, no matter what, and live a life well lived. This is what happiness is to me.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability, taking responsibility for your own life and being mindful are the qualities that will support us all in living our best life &mdash; and when we live our best life, happiness will be quick to follow.</p>"

Working smart means finding the few activities that matter the most and going all in on those to create the best possible results. You get the greatest outcome for every hour worked, and it doesn&rsquo;t get much smarter than that.</p>",

What does &ldquo;value&rdquo; mean in my job? (I devote an entire chapter to this question in my newest book.) What must I say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to in order to do this? And what does it mean to go all in and do exceptional work in my job?</p>\n<p>Working smart also means questioning the latest workplace trends. For example, many people currently believe that&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;is necessarily good and that more is better. Experts advise us to tear down &ldquo;silos&rdquo; in organizations, collaborate more, build large professional networks, and use lots of high-tech communication tools to get work done.</p>\n<p>Well, my research shows that convention to be dead wrong.&nbsp;Top performers collaborate&nbsp;less. They carefully select which projects and tasks to join and which to flee based on value. And they channel a huge degree of effort and resources to excel in the few chosen ones.</p>\n<p>By working on a few key collaboration initiatives, the upshot is that you can do them exceptionally well. Working smart means finding the few activities that matter the most and going all in on those to create the best possible results. You get the greatest outcome for every hour worked, and it doesn&rsquo;t get much smarter than that.</p>"

I've recently come to the conclusion that there are different reasons for burning out, and that someone's personality and worldview probably influence what their reasons are. More important, I can't help but think that if we understand what is driving our potential burn-out, we might have a better chance of addressing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are the five reasons, as I see them.</p>\n<p><strong>1. The \"Work Is My Identity\" Mentality</strong></p>\n<p>Some people launch themselves into burn-out because they define themselves based on the work they do. Their jobs are their personas, and so it only makes sense that they fill their lives with as much of it as possible. People in high-profile positions in business find themselves constantly traveling and working weekends&mdash;even unexcited to go home at the end of a day, because work is where they feel most valued and capable.

          "textOnly": "<p>Over the past 30 years, I've watched plenty of friends, colleagues and clients get burned out at work, and I've experienced my own share of it. I've recently come to the conclusion that there are different reasons for burning out, and that someone's personality and worldview probably influence what their reasons are. More important, I can't help but think that if we understand what is driving our potential burn-out, we might have a better chance of addressing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are the five reasons, as I see them.</p>\n<p><strong>1. The \"Work Is My Identity\" Mentality</strong></p>\n<p>Some people launch themselves into burn-out because they define themselves based on the work they do. Their jobs are their personas, and so it only makes sense that they fill their lives with as much of it as possible. People in high-profile positions in business find themselves constantly traveling and working weekends&mdash;even unexcited to go home at the end of a day, because work is where they feel most valued and capable. These people often complain about working so hard, but in reality, they take on more because they aren't sure what else they would do.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Rather than waste 45 minutes reading the same emails six times in a row, I do something that then allows me to focus for the rest of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Of course, I work for myself and (most days) I work at home. This makes mid-afternoon exercising easier.</p>\n<p>But I don&rsquo;t think during-the-day exercise is impossible for people with &lsquo;normal&rsquo; jobs.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of this recently thanks to a note from blog reader Annette, who lives in Australia. After listening to the audiobook of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lauravanderkam.com/books/168-hours/\">168 Hours</a>, she decided that she wanted to use her 30-minute lunch break to exercise (she noted that she normally worked through lunch or surfed the web).</p>\n<p>The problem, of course, was that it was only 30 minutes. And then there was the question of what condition she&rsquo;d be in afterwards. &ldquo;How are other listeners accounting for time to redo makeup, redo hair, etc.?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It seems the personal care after working out is harder to manage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is true, and is an issue that is generally more problematic for women than men, both because of more complicated hair and make-up, and because women may be judged more on appearances.</p>\n<p>My first suggestion is to rethink the definition of exercise. Any physical movement is good. You do not have to do high-impact aerobic activities that leave you a sweaty mess. You do not have to exercise for an hour.</p>\n<p>A 30-minute lunch break can, on a nice day, allow for a 20-25 minute stroll outside. Just bring comfortable shoes and any necessary coats, gloves, hats, etc. You might even be able to squeeze a few other walk breaks into the day. If people go outside to smoke for a few minutes, go outside as well. Just don&rsquo;t smoke!</p>\n<p>Another option for standard office workers is the walking meeting. One-on-one meetings can be turned into walking meetings if the weather is decent and the other person has been warned in advance (so they don&rsquo;t only have stilettos). This might be a particularly good option if you need to give feedback or advice to someone more junior to you. These conversations often feel more authentic if you&rsquo;re not staring across the table in a beige conference room.</p>\n<p>Or hey, if your workplace is large enough, you might take a fair number of steps just in the course of daily life. Last summer, I spoke at an organization in California that had multiple buildings spread across their campus. One woman whose office moved to the opposite side of the campus from many of her team mates reported that she was now getting so much activity that some stiffness/pain issues were clearing up (it was also hard to avoid being late to meetings, but that was a different matter).</p>\n<p>Even a brisk walk seldom requires redoing hair and make-up. You could stop by the bathroom for 2 minutes after to look in the mirror and make sure nothing has gone terribly wrong. Quickly touch up lipstick and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>\n<p>If you have a little more time, and somewhere you can clean up a bit afterwards, then more options for sweatier activities open up. You might not actually need more break time overall. If your boss is generally flexible, or your schedule is, and you have been taking 30 minutes for lunch, maybe you could take 50 minutes on three days and work through lunch the other two days (you and a colleague could agree to cover for each other if that&rsquo;s required in your job). Or you could take a 45-60 minute break during the day a few days per week but agree to come to work a little earlier or stay later on those days.</p>\n<p>A 45-minute lunch break would be enough time to change (5-10 minutes), run for 25 minutes, and then spend 10-15 minutes making yourself presentable. This could involve a 3-minute shower (with shower cap) if you felt it necessary, 3 minutes getting dressed, with the remainder of the time spent re-powdering and possibly running a hair dryer quickly to fluff everything up, or putting hair in a ponytail or bun. This might not be a great idea if you&rsquo;re presenting to the CEO that afternoon, but could work for a normal afternoon twice a week.</p>\n<p>(No place to shower? Bring wipes and a little towel and maybe a touch-up on deodorant&hellip;though personally I think people can be excessively concerned about this. As long as you get out of your sweaty clothes, you&rsquo;ll probably be fine.)</p>\n<p>If you can take an hour, then you could exercise for 40 minutes (with a 10-minute buffer on either side).</p>\n<p>Or you might aim to do an hour-long class at a nearby gym one day a week. If you take 90 minutes one day, and 15 the other 4 days, that&rsquo;s 150 minutes, or exactly the same as taking 30 minutes a day 5 days a week. This would also be only one day, then, that you&rsquo;d be worrying about post-exercise hair and make-up. But add one lunch-time class to one early morning sweat session and two weekend sweat sessions per week, and you&rsquo;re exercising more days than you&rsquo;re not. Which is pretty good as these things go.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the logistics. Of course, the psychological aspect is more complicated. I have definitely heard from people about office grumbling: how come she has time to exercise? Short walk breaks usually don&rsquo;t inspire the same grumbling, so if you&rsquo;re in that kind of office, that might be the way to go. But you could also choose to be a pioneer. When you come back from an office workout and actually have the energy to focus all afternoon, you can get a lot done. Hopefully, results speak for themselves.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Our work with the team from that financial services company proved to us that, with proper attention to the core principles of leadership accountability and constant attention to ensuring clarity and commitment, almost any team can improve its overall performance.</p>",
      "description": "<p>A senior vice president of a big financial services company asked for a meeting to talk about a concern he had with one of his teams. Typically, this is how things begin: an executive asks me to help fix an average or below-average team and get them back on the right track.</p>\n<p>Except this time, it wasn&rsquo;t a dysfunctional team. This SVP wanted to know if I could take his best team and make them even better.</p>\n<p>At first, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to respond.</p>\n<p>He went on to explain that this particular team regularly achieves 100% of its targets based on measurable results and had been at this level for a long time. The SVP asked me bluntly: &ldquo;Do you think they can do better?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was a fascinating question. We focus most of our work on helping average teams improve. Or, we are called for our opinion on whether a totally dysfunctional team should be saved or blown up. But take a team from good to great? That was different&mdash;and exhilarating.</p>\n<p>Still, we dove headlong into the work, interviewing team members and dissecting the dynamics that governed their work. We used the same tools and approaches we would use with a team that was missing its targets. And wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, some interesting issues started to arise.</p>\n<p>The members of this team had clearly started to take their success for granted. Once they realized they were close to hitting their targets, and their bonuses were secure, they began to ease off the accelerator. It was almost as if they had become complacent about being good, so much so that they never really considered becoming exceptional.</p>\n<p>We worked closely with the team members to find that extra gear, and the results were extraordinary.</p>\n<p>In the first year after we had contact with this team, it achieved 135% of its measurable goals. There was no longer any doubt in my mind: good teams, even great teams, can become exceptional with the right help.</p>\n<p>That anecdote has always been an important reminder to me about the importance of our work to improve team performance.</p>\n<p>Teams are the backbone of most companies, and most companies are going through an extremely difficult period of disruption and change.</p>\n<p>Just look at the business landscape today: the onset of seismic disruption from digital technology; intensifying global competition; sweeping demographic changes; increased regulatory pressures; political and economic uncertainty. Our traditional concepts of work and organizational structure are being reshaped in profound ways.</p>\n<p>As a response, organizations are transforming, both in the way they do things and, sometimes, by adopting entirely new business models. And in many instances, those organizations are relying on teams to help plan and execute critical transformation initiatives.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at a time when we are relying on teams more than ever before, it&rsquo;s clear they are not stepping up to meet these increasing expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>LOW LEVEL OF SATISFACTION WITH TEAM PERFORMANCE</strong><br />\nTo gain greater insight into the current state of teams, LHH partnered with the Human Capital Institute (HCI) to survey more than 250 professionals, ranging from individual contributors to C-level executives at mid-sized to large organizations across North America.</p>\n<p>The survey results confirmed that the majority of organizations (92%) believed that high-per- forming teams were essential to organization- al success. However, only 23% were satisfied with the performance of their current teams.</p>\n<p>How did this gap between expectation and performance come to be? A deeper examination reveals that the very nature of teams has changed dramatically.</p>\n<p><strong>TEAMS FOR THE NEW AGE</strong><br />\nTeams have traditionally involved a leader and a group of followers, all co-located in the same place to create regular, face-to-face contact. The team leader would organize the work and assess performance. Team members executed the plan.</p>\n<p>Today, the team dynamic is much different.</p>\n<p>Workplaces have gone global. Matrix structures now require teams to work across departments, functions and geographies. Fellow team members could be located down the hall or on the other side of the planet. Relationships are largely virtual&mdash;a voice during a conference call or an image from a video link.</p>\n<p>Teams today are also more fluid and numerous than in the past. Teams are formed, disbanded and rebuilt continually. This means one may participate on several teams at once, either as the leader or as a team member.</p>\n<p>The rapidly evolving role and function of teams certainly seems to be taking its toll. But how much of a toll?</p>\n<p>We conducted a more intensive survey with leaders from various sized companies representing more than 20 different industries across the United States. We asked these leaders to rate their existing teams on a spectrum of 32 behaviors. We also asked survey respondents to answer several open-ended questions to better understand their thinking on team performance.</p>\n<p>What we found was a crisis in team performance.</p>\n<p>Among the more startling results is the fact that most organizations believe their teams are average at best. A whopping 88% of sur- vey respondents rated their teams as average, below average or poor. Only 6% of respondents rated their teams as truly exceptional.</p>\n<p>Think about that for a moment. At a time when organizations need their teams to be at their strongest, we find that they are unclear, aimless and uncommitted.</p>\n<p><strong>THE FOUNDATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF TEAM ACCOUNTABILITY</strong><br />\nAs startling as the survey results were, they did not explain why certain teams had been able to rise above the stress and strain of transformation to achieve exceptional results. Digging deeper into the survey results through interviews of HR executives, we found that they kept returning to two foundational qualities of high-performing, account- able teams: clarity and commitment.</p>\n<p><strong>CLARITY</strong><br />\nOur respondents were definitive: a successful, accountable team must be a clear-thinking team. That largely means ensuring every team member has a clear, unambiguous under- standing about the business context in which it operates.</p>\n<p>Teams must be clear on their core purpose and strategy as it relates to the overall organization. The team must clearly understand the expectations of key stakeholders both inside and outside the organization. Finally, the team has absolute clarity about what needs to get done, how it needs to get done and when.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, we learned through our research that a great many team members do not have a collective understanding of the strategy of their team. They also do not fully appreciate how everyone&rsquo;s work contributes to the execution of the strategy. Without clarity, leaders and their teams are flying blind, unsure of where they&rsquo;re going, why they are going there and what is expected of them along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>COMMITMENT</strong><br />\nCommitment ensures every member is &ldquo;all in&rdquo; and fully engaged on the team&rsquo;s mission. They show a willingness to work with other people and teams across the organization. They are committed to the idea of collective leadership, both on their team and for others in the organization. In short, they demonstrate a deep commitment to each other.</p>\n<p>The most important aspect of commitment is that team members are passionate about the future of the organization. This implies that the executives and others need to paint a positive vision for the future as the critical building block in building commitment. Without this key component, it will be difficult to obtain a high degree of commitment from teams and anyone else for that matter.</p>\n<p>The next component is that everyone needs to fully commit to executing the organization&rsquo;s strategic priorities. Once team members are clear on the future vision and the strategy, they can commit to executing the strategy to achieve the vision.</p>\n<p>These findings strongly suggest that the most important determinants of commitment need to be provided by the organization. With these in place, the team can drive the other components of commitment: supporting each other&rsquo;s development as leaders; breaking down silos to collaborate across the organization; and holding each other accountable by calling out unproductive leadership behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>CLARITY AND COMMITMENT ARE INTERTWINED</strong><br />\nA key finding of our study is that clarity and commitment are correlated to a highly significant degree. In other words, organizations that are composed of teams with a high degree of clarity also show a high degree of commitment. This finding implies that clarity is the foundation of commitment.</p>\n<p>If there is little or no clarity on the goals, mandate and leadership culture needed to succeed, then commitment will remain at moderate levels or, in some cases, erode to potentially dysfunctional levels.&nbsp; Either way, it leads to underperforming, unremarkable teams.</p>\n<p>This significant finding suggests that team leaders must work both on clarity and commitment at the same time. If you increase one, you&rsquo;ll increase the other.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br />\nAfter looking at the current state of teams, it could be easy to give in to despair. How can companies trust their teams to drive performance and transformation if the problems seem to outweigh the solutions?</p>\n<p>While this is true of teams today&mdash;confirmed by our interviews, research and consulting experience working with teams across the globe&mdash;we need to acknowledge another truth: team performance can be improved.</p>\n<p>Our work with the team from that financial services company proved to us that, with proper attention to the core principles of leadership accountability and constant attention to ensuring clarity and commitment, almost any team can improve its overall performance.</p>\n<p>The poorest performing teams obviously have the largest opportunity for improvement. But even average and strong teams can reach extraordinary performance with careful attention to the principles of accountability, clarity and commitment.</p>\n<p>Not all teams can be saved. But the good news is that the vast majority of teams cannot only be saved, they can be improved to an exceptional degree.</p>",

He is dead serious, but he&rsquo;s not in the slightest bit mean. And that, right there, is what every leader of a healthy organization needs to learn how to do. Consistently, persistently, lovingly hold people accountable, not just for hitting their numbers or achieving their goals, but first and foremost, for the behaviors that the organization requires.</p>\n<p>If the meetings example wasn&rsquo;t basic enough, consider how Alan handled his senior executives using their phones during meetings for texting or checking the news. He would stop and just look at them intently, until they put their phones away. Yes, like a seventh grade teacher.

The thing is, if squashing bad behavior doesn&rsquo;t start at the top, it won&rsquo;t happen below. And that means that a CEO, more than any other person, has to be brutally intolerant of any behavior that contradicts what he or she is trying to create to make the organization healthy.

      "summary": "<p>A small regional call center in Kansas City that was struggling to improve customer satisfaction.&nbsp; It needed a quick way for a floor manager to identify when an agent needed help with a customer. The current solution &mdash;which was software based, features on the phone etc.&mdash;at the time just wasn&rsquo;t working quickly enough.</p>",
      "description": "<p>In 2012 the bosses of Philips Hue (ADR) engineers George Yianni and Filip Jan Depauwe were asked a baffling question: why more than one hundred thirty years after Edison&rsquo;s invention had light bulbs hardly changed at all while everything around them had? The developed world now lived in a reality of personal computers, cellular phones, digital games, transcontinental airlines and the internet. Yet, the now-prosaic little light bulb, lighting up homes around the globe and sold by the billions every year, had yet to be supplanted by another technological breakthrough. Was it really that irreplaceable?</p>\n<p>Philips had a major stake in finding the answer. For almost 90 percent of the history of the technology itself, Philips had been making light bulbs. However, not much had changed during that time. But now a new reality had set in &ndash; the context of the market was changing and changing quickly due to the advent of technologies not available to them even a decade before. As Philips management looked around they saw the consumer interest in alternative illumination technologies &ndash; notably the light emitting diode (LED) was gaining interest as &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; and energy efficiency was entering the consumer consciousness. It realized that the time was ripe for a major disruption, and they knew that if they weren&rsquo;t willing to disrupt themselves, someone else would do it for them. Philips wanted to get there first, but the essential question was how?</p>\n<p>In following the Philips story while researching the nature of corporate growth, I was surprised to discover that instead of what is assumed to be a near-infinite number of options for a company to take to improve its current circumstances, there are in fact, just ten paths to growth. Prior to choosing which path is best, it is important to understand the competitive&nbsp;context&nbsp;in which the company finds itself, the&nbsp;<em>combination</em>&nbsp;of actions it must take to pursue a path, and the&nbsp;sequence&nbsp;in which those actions need to be taken. They needed to sharpen their&nbsp;<em>Growth IQ.</em></p>\n<p>Philips was dialed into the shift in market context, so it clearly understood what it needed to do, but it also realized it needed to more than just produce a LED lightbulb. Looking at one of the most mature, and commoditized industries imaginable, Philips decided to reimagine what it meant to &ldquo;light up a room&rdquo; by offering a whole new product technology to the billions of existing customers &ndash; what I&rsquo;ve called&nbsp;product expansion <em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em>as well as attract an entirely new set of customers and use cases &ndash; what I&rsquo;ve called&nbsp;customer and product diversification. In the end, it chose to empower its design lab to think beyond the status quo and come up with a radical new product with a whole new type of functionality (digital, networking, adjustable palette of millions of colors) and use- cases, then roll it out supported by an ad campaign called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2014/09/18/philips-hue-connected-lighting-ad-shows-viewers-history-light-bulb\" target=\"_blank\">How Many Years Does it Take to Change a Light Bulb</a>&rdquo; &ndash; a parody of sorts showing a single while lightbulb hanging from the ceiling of the same house, over a different family, as the decades passed.</p>\n<p>Unlike anything they had tried before, Yianni and Depauwe were given just 11 months to &lsquo;make a splash&rsquo; and leverage 50 years of innovation with LEDs. This compresses timeline put everyone in the company on notice that this wasn&rsquo;t going to be business as usual. It was looking for a once-in-a-lifetime idea &ndash;one that could have the potential to revolutionize not only home lighting, but also the emotional connection people had with such a commoditized and consistent product such as the light bulb. An important clue to the direction they should pursue came from Jim Andrew, Philips chief strategy and innovation officer.&nbsp; He proposed that whatever light the team invented, it should incorporate digital into the equation, instead of just looking at the traditional analog technology. This was the perfect storm for Phillips. It had an impending market shift in customer preference and context, it had access to new technical capabilities, and unwavering executive support. The result? Phillips was able to capitalize on all three to deliver a true revolution in lighting.</p>\n<p>Faced with such a challenge, the two designers had an epiphany &ndash; a true &ldquo;light bulb&rdquo; moment that the light bulb had been waiting for all these years.&nbsp; With their team they set as their goal not just a new consumer product but actually opening people&rsquo;s eyes to the possibility of creating value beyond mere illumination:&nbsp; an LED-based, digitally &lsquo;connected&rsquo; and networked light bulb capable of ranging across 16 million different colors all controlled by a &lsquo;smartphone.&rsquo;&nbsp; With those range of colors, its ability to accept digital signals, and its lifespan of decades, home and commercial lighting wouldn&rsquo;t just be about illumination, but about seeing and feeling better &ndash; and as an atmospheric conveyor of information. That&rsquo;s when Phillips Hue was born.</p>\n<p>The Yianni/Depauwe team met their deadline. Now their new Hue light bulb had to be rolled out into the world.&nbsp; In the much slower, more insular world of the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, Edison had years with little competition to introduce and proliferate his light bulb.&nbsp; In the fast-paced global marketplace of the 21<sup>st&nbsp;</sup>century, with hungry competitors ready to swarm, Philips had mere months. Now Philips knew how it wanted to grow, it had defined the new product it was going to introduce and the path it would use to drive growth.</p>\n<p>While this may seem counterintuitive, that was only the second part of the challenge &ndash; first, the company had to sell the new light technology to its own established corporate culture. This is where the sequence comes into play. Knowing what you want to do, doesn&rsquo;t mean you can just act on it immediately. You must ensure you are establishing the right level of internal &lsquo;buy-in&rsquo; to get everyone rallied around an entirely new kind of product and frankly a new value proposition. It wasn&rsquo;t about just lighting a room, it was about creating a personalized and connected experience with color and light. After all, Philips had manufactured traditional bulbs for more than a century &ndash; and this new technology not only smashed the hegemony of that technology but ultimately also demanded a new radical way of thinking about designing and launching products. In other words, Philips had to sell the idea internally before it sold its new Hue product to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>It took a company-wide campaign over the next few months to begin that process. Engineers had to be told to design-in the new technology as part of the user experience and focus on the &lsquo;feeling&rsquo; lighting can provide and not just providing &lsquo;white light.&rsquo; The sequence of these internal cultural changes were critical to the overall success of Philips Hue. Management had to stay on top of the process to keep the culture from sliding back into the old ways, what it had always done, successfully I might add, for 130 years. In the end, it took a combination of training, reinforcement, rewards and penalties to force the change. But surprisingly quickly, the connected, adaptable software driven culture started by the Hue light bulb permeated all Philips products, from $40 DVD players to million-dollar MRI scanners.</p>\n<p>But one very big step remained: adoption. It took a half-century from Edison&rsquo;s Lab to that evening when all America turned off its lights in tribute. Could Philips at least start down the path to social assimilation of its new lighting technology? Eric Rondolat, Philips&rsquo; global CEO for lighting believed that &lsquo;the company that understands outcomes and applications will be the company that thrives&rsquo;. So, were there other uses cases besides providing &ldquo;light&rsquo; that would emerge out in the world that would point the way? Would users discover a way to use this new technology to solve an intractable problem &ndash; would they have their own &ldquo;light bulb moments&rdquo;?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One such moment arrived at the most unlikely place.&nbsp; A small regional call center in Kansas City that was struggling to improve customer satisfaction.&nbsp; It needed a quick way for a floor manager to identify when an agent needed help with a customer. The current solution &mdash;which was software based, features on the phone etc.&mdash;at the time just wasn&rsquo;t working quickly enough.</p>\n<p>Then one day, an IT manager at the call center heard me tell the Philips Hue lighting story at a conference in Phoenix Arizona in 2013. He practically ran up to me after I got off stage to tell me that the metaphorical &lsquo;light bulb&rsquo; went off when he was listening to me. He could solve the problem about notifying floor managers by putting one of those new connected digital light bulbs above each cubical. Called up on the computer by the operator, that light could quickly provide visual notification based upon color when a call agent needed help.&nbsp; It was a simple, elegant and inexpensive solution for which the new Philips&rsquo; lights were uniquely suited.</p>\n<p>Was this the original intention when Philips decided to pivot towards a connected lightbulb with 16 million different colors, I&rsquo;m guessing not. But it didn&rsquo;t matter. The call center got its solution, Philips took a new path and proved to its customers its Growth IQ in lighting technology (and saw a growth jump in the process) &ndash; and, it turned out, was credited with one of the pioneering products in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT).&nbsp; I got a great story to tell . . . and the light bulb finally got its &ldquo;light bulb moment&rdquo; &ndash; indeed several of them.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Theoretically, I&rsquo;m a surfer.</p>\n<p>I am always on the lookout for&mdash;even pursuing&mdash;the next big wave.

I began to realize S curves are good models for human learning curves too. At the base of the S, progress is slow and there is a high degree of challenge learning something new; eventually a tipping point is reached.

And I advocate that we each need to catch a new wave on a more or less regular basis. Neuroscientists argue that cognitive effort, stimulated by learning something new, keeps our brains humming along with dopamine and other feel-good neurotransmitters.

Take the Right Risks</strong><br />\nA wave can get pretty crowded with multiple surfers. Instead of trying to go head to head with a colleague or competitor, try to find a unique wave, one that isn&rsquo;t occupied by someone else. If you create or step into a role (or innovate a new product, service, business, etc.) that meets a presently <em>unmet</em> need, you greatly increase your chances of success. Look to play where others aren&rsquo;t; being the first surfer on the wave gives you the advantage over all who might challenge you later.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Play to Your Distinctive Strengths</strong><br />\nWhat are you not just good at, but uniquely good? What have you always done well, even in childhood? What makes you odd? Consider a compliment that you frequently receive and are quick to dismiss. Or, watch for the things that irritate you in other people. Carl Jung famously said, &ldquo;Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.&rdquo; I have found this to be a good gauge of our superpower(s). Most of us are annoyed by the ineptness of others at the things we naturally do well.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Embrace Constraints</strong><br />\n&lsquo;Constraint&rsquo; sounds like a limitation on freedom. But constraints are liberating; without them we are bogged down by an over-abundance of options. Fortunately, at the low end of an S curve wave, there are inevitably limitations&mdash;too little time, money, expertise, buy-in. In fact, unlimited options can be paralyzing, an impairment to good decision-making. Fewer options force us to prioritize, emphasize resourcefulness and innovate. Innovation is the coin of the realm.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Battle Entitlement</strong><br />\nI have called entitlement the sneaky saboteur of personal disruption. Entitlement is a close cohort of complacency and leads is into unprofitable paths of ease, low-learning, low-growth and stagnation. The entitled hesitate to abandon their position of relative comfort to tackle the challenges found at the low end of a new learning curve.

To battle entitlement we relinquish our hold on the wave we&rsquo;ve mastered and leap to a new wave with lots of energy still to expend.</p>\n<p><strong>6.

      "description": "<p>During the summer of 2015, Pierre Nanterme, Accenture&rsquo;s CEO, announced that the global professional services company would reimagine its performance management system. The company found that after decades of serving its purpose, the system had become massively demotivating. Accenture&rsquo;s global workforce had changed. Their people&mdash;and your people&mdash;are not motivated by being a number on a performance rating scale. Rather, today&rsquo;s workforce is increasingly looking for meaning, human connectedness, true happiness, and a desire to contribute positively to the world. Nanterme and his leadership team realized Accenture needed a better way to lead for these foundational human desires and better engage their 425,000-plus employees&mdash;to speak to their intrinsic motivation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Accenture is no outlier. A global movement is taking place in the C-suites of thousands of progressive organizations like Marriott, Starbucks, and LinkedIn. The question the leaders of these organizations ask themselves is, &ldquo;How can we create more human leadership and people-centered cultures where employees and leaders are more fulfilled and more fully engaged?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As human beings, we are all driven by basic needs for meaning, happiness, human connectedness, and a desire to contribute positively to society. That&rsquo;s true whether we&rsquo;re at home, out in the world, or at work. But it&rsquo;s one thing to realize this and another to act on it. Speaking to our people&rsquo;s intrinsic motivation calls for leadership and organizations that cater to these desires. It&rsquo;s something that forward-thinking organizations and leaders are increasingly realizing and addressing. As Javier Pladevall, CEO of Audi Volkswagen, Spain, reflected when we spoke with him: &ldquo;Leadership today is about unlearning management and relearning being human.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>How important is this message? Consider this: In a 2016 McKinsey &amp; Company study of more than fifty-two thousand managers, 86 percent rated themselves as inspiring and good role models. But this stands in stark contrast to how employees perceive their leaders. A 2016 Gallup engagement survey found that 82 percent of employees see their leaders as fundamentally uninspiring. In fact, the same survey found that only 13 percent of the global workforce is engaged, while 24 percent are actively disengaged.</p>\n<p>This seeming lack of good leadership is not because of a lack of effort. According to a recent report, organizations around the globe invest approximately $46 billion annually on leadership development programs. That&rsquo;s a lot of money for seemingly little return. What&rsquo;s going wrong?</p>\n<p>We conducted a 2-year research study, to find the strategies for great leadership in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We interviewed 250 C-suite executives from Microsoft, Google, McKinsey, Lego and more, assessed 35,000 leaders and trawled through thousands of studies of leadership. From this work, we came to two clear findings.</p>\n<p>First; leadership education has got it backwards. Leadership pioneer Peter Drucker said, &ldquo;You cannot manage other people unless you manage yourself first.&rdquo; Much leadership education starts with skills like strategy, vision and finance. But from Drucker&rsquo;s point of view, this approach starts at the end and misses the beginning. It&rsquo;s like building a house by starting with the roof.</p>\n<p>Our research found that leadership starts with yourself. More specifically, it starts in your mind. By understanding how your mind works, you can lead yourself effectively. By understanding and leading yourself effectively, you can understand others and be able to lead them more effectively. And by understanding and leading others more effectively, you can understand and lead your organization more effectively&mdash;and by &ldquo;more effectively,&rdquo; we mean in a way that&rsquo;s going to tap into your own and your people&rsquo;s intrinsic motivations and sense of purpose. If you&rsquo;re able to do that&mdash;and we have witnessed that with practice and persistence, anyone can&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have a more engaged and productive workforce. And perhaps more importantly, you&rsquo;ll be part of creating more happiness, stronger human connectedness, and better social cohesion within and beyond your organization.</p>\n<p>Second, we found that three key mental qualities stand out in great leaders: mindfulness, selflessness and compassion. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mindfulness is about learning to manage your attention &ndash; a critical skill for today&rsquo;s leaders. When you learn how to manage your attention, you learn how to manage your thoughts. Mindfulness provides leaders with a stellar focus on the task or person at hand enabling greater productivity as well as an ability to be truly present with people. Professor Jochen Reb of Singapore Management University found, there&rsquo;s a direct correlation between leaders&rsquo; mindfulness and the well-being and performance of their people.&nbsp;Mindfulness gives us the ability to better manage our mind and as leaders, direct it towards things that are beneficial for yourself and your organization.</p>\n<p>Selflessness in leadership is the wisdom of getting out of your own way; not letting your own natural egoistic tendencies to prevent you from being of best service to your team. According to research by Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at University of California, Berkeley, leaders are more likely to engage in rude, selfish, and unethical behavior.&nbsp;Cultivating selflessness counters these inclinations. It is defined by a strong sense of humility and the ability to be of service to others. Selfless leadership is about understanding that leadership success is based on an ability to skillfully develop the potential of people.</p>\n<p>Compassion in leadership is the quality of having positive intentions for others. Researchers from the University of North Carolina Business School found that compassionate leaders are perceived as both stronger and better leaders.&nbsp;With compassion, a leader increases trust and social cohesion because it is clear they are looking out for the best interests of the team. People are more likely to go the extra mile for a compassionate leader because they know they have their back. But don&rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that compassion is about always being nice. Compassionate leadership is also about giving tough feedback and making difficult decisions. It requires wisdom and courage.</p>\n<p>Leading with mindfulness, selflessness, and compassion makes you more human and less leader. It makes you more you and less your title. By bring more humanity into our leadership we can create happier, healthier and more productive work environments for ourselves, our people, our organizations and beyond.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in getting started on becoming more mindful, selfless and compassionate <a href=\"https://www.potentialproject.com/hbr-focus/\">here</a> is a link to an app that will get you started on the journey.&nbsp;</p>",

It&rsquo;s something that forward-thinking organizations and leaders are increasingly realizing and addressing. As Javier Pladevall, CEO of Audi Volkswagen, Spain, reflected when we spoke with him: &ldquo;Leadership today is about unlearning management and relearning being human.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>How important is this message? Consider this: In a 2016 McKinsey &amp; Company study of more than fifty-two thousand managers, 86 percent rated themselves as inspiring and good role models. But this stands in stark contrast to how employees perceive their leaders. A 2016 Gallup engagement survey found that 82 percent of employees see their leaders as fundamentally uninspiring. In fact, the same survey found that only 13 percent of the global workforce is engaged, while 24 percent are actively disengaged.</p>\n<p>This seeming lack of good leadership is not because of a lack of effort. According to a recent report, organizations around the globe invest approximately $46 billion annually on leadership development programs. That&rsquo;s a lot of money for seemingly little return. What&rsquo;s going wrong?</p>\n<p>We conducted a 2-year research study, to find the strategies for great leadership in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We interviewed 250 C-suite executives from Microsoft, Google, McKinsey, Lego and more, assessed 35,000 leaders and trawled through thousands of studies of leadership. From this work, we came to two clear findings.</p>\n<p>First; leadership education has got it backwards. Leadership pioneer Peter Drucker said, &ldquo;You cannot manage other people unless you manage yourself first.&rdquo; Much leadership education starts with skills like strategy, vision and finance. But from Drucker&rsquo;s point of view, this approach starts at the end and misses the beginning. It&rsquo;s like building a house by starting with the roof.</p>\n<p>Our research found that leadership starts with yourself. More specifically, it starts in your mind. By understanding how your mind works, you can lead yourself effectively. By understanding and leading yourself effectively, you can understand others and be able to lead them more effectively. And by understanding and leading others more effectively, you can understand and lead your organization more effectively&mdash;and by &ldquo;more effectively,&rdquo; we mean in a way that&rsquo;s going to tap into your own and your people&rsquo;s intrinsic motivations and sense of purpose. If you&rsquo;re able to do that&mdash;and we have witnessed that with practice and persistence, anyone can&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have a more engaged and productive workforce. And perhaps more importantly, you&rsquo;ll be part of creating more happiness, stronger human connectedness, and better social cohesion within and beyond your organization.</p>\n<p>Second, we found that three key mental qualities stand out in great leaders: mindfulness, selflessness and compassion. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mindfulness is about learning to manage your attention &ndash; a critical skill for today&rsquo;s leaders. When you learn how to manage your attention, you learn how to manage your thoughts. Mindfulness provides leaders with a stellar focus on the task or person at hand enabling greater productivity as well as an ability to be truly present with people. Professor Jochen Reb of Singapore Management University found, there&rsquo;s a direct correlation between leaders&rsquo; mindfulness and the well-being and performance of their people.&nbsp;Mindfulness gives us the ability to better manage our mind and as leaders, direct it towards things that are beneficial for yourself and your organization.</p>\n<p>Selflessness in leadership is the wisdom of getting out of your own way; not letting your own natural egoistic tendencies to prevent you from being of best service to your team. According to research by Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at University of California, Berkeley, leaders are more likely to engage in rude, selfish, and unethical behavior.&nbsp;Cultivating selflessness counters these inclinations. It is defined by a strong sense of humility and the ability to be of service to others. Selfless leadership is about understanding that leadership success is based on an ability to skillfully develop the potential of people.</p>\n<p>Compassion in leadership is the quality of having positive intentions for others. Researchers from the University of North Carolina Business School found that compassionate leaders are perceived as both stronger and better leaders.&nbsp;With compassion, a leader increases trust and social cohesion because it is clear they are looking out for the best interests of the team. People are more likely to go the extra mile for a compassionate leader because they know they have their back. But don&rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that compassion is about always being nice. Compassionate leadership is also about giving tough feedback and making difficult decisions. It requires wisdom and courage.</p>\n<p>Leading with mindfulness, selflessness, and compassion makes you more human and less leader. It makes you more you and less your title. By bring more humanity into our leadership we can create happier, healthier and more productive work environments for ourselves, our people, our organizations and beyond.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in getting started on becoming more mindful, selfless and compassionate <a href=\"https://www.potentialproject.com/hbr-focus/\">here</a> is a link to an app that will get you started on the journey.&nbsp;</p>"

      "description": "<p>Working life never ceases to be a cause of stress. Deadlines, responsibilities, the rigours of maintaining excellence and high performance; and just too many items to action that we are always chasing to catch up with are some of the pressures that over time have the potential to really get us down and feeling tired, overworked, and super stressed. All this can really knock our sense of confidence and our sense of self-worth, making us feel small. So how can we use our body language to build ourselves big again, manage stress, make ourselves feel more confident, become more calm and assertive and in so doing, always come across as trustworthy and credible?</p>\n<p>When we feel small and unconfident, our body language can often display these feelings to others, as we will often minimize our size and impact by displaying submissive body language. Submissive body language is characterized by gestures that make us look like we are caving in, defensive, reclusive or indecisive &mdash; in short, body language that makes us look powerless. Submissive body language shows that we do not want to take the power position, nor do we want to be in control&hellip; when the reality may be entirely the opposite!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Submissive body language where we appear that we are taking up less space and looking small may also have us making less noise. We take up as little nonverbal real estate as possible, be it physical, aural, or temporal. When we are more confident not only do we often take up more physical space but we also maximise the volume of the sounds that we make and the time we take up with all of this. In a meeting this will come across as &ldquo;speaking up&rdquo; or &ldquo;getting our point through&rdquo; but of course at the overly confident or dominant end of the spectrum it can come across as &ldquo;hogging the air space&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Of course context is key to all body language and so submissive body language can appear more extreme when seen next to someone exhibiting more dominant body language, gestures that take up space, sound and time. If someone is moving loudly and decisively through territory over sustained periods, you&rsquo;ll notice them; so the opposite, the submissive body language, may appear as more extreme in relation to that. Some of these gestures are: cringing, which looks smaller and non-threatening; head bowing; wide eyed innocent &ldquo;startled&rdquo; staring of the freeze, flight, fight, faint system; hunched shoulders of fear or passiveness; we may even look physically unbalanced, like we could be pushed over. Crossed, defensive postures can also trigger others into feeling you are submissive or indecisive. When you cross your body you hinder your ability to move, and therefore although you may feel less vulnerable, you may look to others and even feel in yourself more passive. Not a great position to be assertively negotiating from!</p>\n<p>Add to this the physical and psychological impact of always holding and staring down at our smartphones, and there is the opportunity to compound the effect of giving off passive or submissive body language. Body language expert and TED Talk sensation Amy Cuddy explains a correlation between the bad posture so many of us experience from using smartphones &mdash; what she calls iPosture, also referred to as iHunch by New Zealand physiotherapist Steve August &mdash; and the psychological damage and changes in behavior that result. Citing studies that link depressed postures to lower self-esteem and mood, greater fear and more negative verbal reactions to questions, Cuddy&rsquo;s research finds that the &ldquo;slouchy, collapsed position we take when using our phones actually makes us less assertive &mdash; less likely to stand up for ourselves when the situation calls for it,&rdquo; and she recommends we counter these physical effects with exercises and stretches&hellip; or trips to the osteopath! The good news is that there are some things that we can quite simply and effectively do for ourselves.</p>\n<p>So with all the stress, overwork, pressure to be responsive and accompanying postures forcing you into looking and feeling submissive and non-assertive, let&rsquo;s look at how you can counter these postures, assert yourself through your body language, help yourself regain your calm, shed the stress, and show colleagues and employers that you are capable, trustworthy and credible. Here are three top tips that you can do right now:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Take Space</strong><br />\nTry taking up more physical space. First off, sit up straight. If you are at a table, move your chair back 6 inches so you are showing off more of a physical presence to others at the table. Place your hands on the table so that you are taking up more territory as well. Place your smartphone on the table and push it away from you to take up even more territory and also to keep yourself from reaching for it and hiding away with it. You can even stand up sometimes when you are speaking or making important points.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Torso Talk</strong><br />\nPlace your hands in what we have trademarked the TruthPlane, the horizontal plane that extends 180 degrees out of your navel area. Bringing the audience's unconscious attention to this vulnerable area of your body makes them feel that you are very confident. By assuming this physicality, you will <em>feel</em> confident too!&nbsp;And by showing your palms open with nothing in your hands to let others know that you mean no harm and are speaking for their benefit you will also feel more open and commanding while still giving a universally recognised 'friendly' gesture.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Reveal Yourself</strong><br />\nAvoid having your hands at mouth level when speaking, for example when sitting at a table with your chin in your hands, often a physical symptom of feeling stress and pressure weighing us down and making us look more passive or submissive. We lip read more than we think, and when the picture of the words is taken away it becomes harder to verify the language. The audience will perceive or create negative feelings about your intentions &mdash; in the absence of information, we 'make it up' and always lean towards the negative to prepare for the worst when theorising about the inner thoughts of others.&nbsp;And by covering yourself up and minimising the space you take you may compound the feeling that you have nothing worth saying in the first place!</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>From his glory days at Boeing, to Thunder Roads at Ford, Alan Mulally is still The Boss.</strong></p>\n<p>Simply put, Alan Roger Mulally is the Bruce Springsteen of CEOs - the consummate frontman. For 37 successful years, he was the Executive Vice President of Boeing and the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. He joined the Ford Motor Company in 2006 with the company in turmoil. Shortly after, he secured enough private money to keep the company afloat. He took the struggling automotive giant from the brink of disaster to soaring profitability. Along the way, he picked up awards - lots of them. Mulally was No. 3 on Fortune's list of World's Greatest Leaders, is listed as one of Barron's World's Best CEOs, and was Automotive News magazine's Industry Leader of the Year. Not bad for a kid who, at the age of 17, was inspired by President John Kennedy&rsquo;s challenge to send a man to the moon.</p>\n<p>But this isn&rsquo;t a story about how a car company went from a staggering $17.6 billion loss to one of the greatest turnarounds in American business history. This is a story about a corporate leader, a keen student of leadership and communication, and how he kept his talent from jumping off a sinking ship while reinventing a corporate culture. In his own words, &ldquo;Leadership is having a compelling vision, a comprehensive plan, relentless implementation, and talented people working together.&rdquo; Connection played a major role in Mulally&rsquo;s leadership style. He is often quoted as saying, &ldquo;People want meaning. All of us want to know that we are doing great things, that we are touching a lot of people, and that what we are doing is something bigger than ourselves.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It all began with a plan. Mulally communicated with infectious optimism, frequently quoting company founder Henry Ford. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re giving people the freedom of mobility&rdquo; and &ldquo;take advantage of opportunity&rdquo; were oft-heard phrases. He was personable and made people feel important. He was single-minded in his expression of his vision and used it to evaluate everything from car design and consumer benefits to corporate decision making. True to his notions of strategy and communication, Mulally brought his vision and plan to life with 'One Ford'.</p>\n<p>The strategy itself was made up of 4 different goals: 1. bring all employees together as a global team 2. leverage Ford&rsquo;s unique knowledge and assets 3. build vehicles people wanted 4. get financing in place to pay for it all. He created 'One Team' to eliminate pre-existing silos and turf battles. He created a simplified leadership structure that aligned with his vision to get people to work together across the company as a global team. Says Mulally, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about people working together for the good of all of us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2008, he had a chance to test his plan when he championed Ford&rsquo;s decision to go to Congress with GM and Chrysler to call for a federal rescue. Ford didn&rsquo;t need rescuing. In fact, Mulally had previously arranged a multi-billion-dollar line of credit that he secured by personally appealing to the biggest banks in America. Mulally re-established Ford&rsquo;s credibility and got the ball rolling for his turnaround plan. He believed that GM and Chrysler threatened to drag the entire country into a depression and that going before Congress was &ldquo;the right thing for the industry and the right thing for the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mulally continued to get everyone focused on what was best for Ford. He recognized that the potential was there but he needed to activate it. He made a speech to 4,000 Ford employees and car dealers where he asked the executive team to stand and look the dealers in the eye. He then asked the executive team to tell the dealers they loved them. According to a dealer who was there, it was the defining moment when the culture at Ford began its transformation. Mulally knew that without trust, cooperation, and teamwork, the plan would fail. He believed then, as he does now, that you can&rsquo;t just be there for your people. You have to love them.</p>\n<p>From the beginning, Mulally prioritized open communication and galvanized his employees by stating &ldquo;We have been going out of business for 40 years&rdquo; at one of the company&rsquo;s town hall meetings. The statement was profoundly accurate and had a major impact on employees. Leaders who value their people don&rsquo;t view them just as a means to an end. Mulally gave his employees a voice, and would often seek out their ideas and opinions, holding weekly meetings to review his plan. He encouraged honest dialogue, forbidding anyone in his meetings to use humor at the expense of others because it undermined honesty and connection.</p>\n<p>He also knew how to retain his top talent, discovering hidden potential amongst existing employees and growing his teams while he recharged the corporate culture at Ford with very little churn in human resources. Being united in corporate culture also paved the way for a more technologically driven company with a focus on innovation.</p>\n<p>Part of the 'One Ford' vision was to bring suppliers, customers, and even the unions into the fold as partners. This would have the double benefit of helping convince the skeptics that the organization was really in the midst of positive change that would benefit everyone. Mulally&rsquo;s plan was that Ford would communicate clearly and with great detail why the situation was now different, how things had changed, what was going to be required for the turnaround to be successful, and what the organization was willing to do so that everyone could share in the success. And he never looked back. Ford went on to post record profits with soaring stock prices.</p>\n<p>Mulally stepped down as the President and CEO in 2014, but he&rsquo;s still performing in the spotlight. He is on the Google (now Alphabet) Board of Directors, the subject of a book outlining his monumental achievements at Ford called &ldquo;American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company&rdquo; and was considered to become the next Secretary of State by the Trump Administration.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Where are you right now in your work and your career? Are you in a place that feels satisfying and gives scope to your talents? Are you valued not just for your contributions but also for your potential? And do you feel your work is leading to a place that will satisfy your ambitions and help you make the difference you want to make in the world?</p>\n<p>After all, you get to define what success means to you. You get to define what it means to rise. Maybe for you it&rsquo;s moving to a higher, more lucrative position. Maybe it&rsquo;s finding a wider playing field or getting more recognition for your work. Maybe you want more say in the direction your organization will take in the future. Perhaps you want to create a new business or product. Maybe you want to instill a spirit of joy among your collaborators, customers, and clients. Or you&rsquo;re fired by the desire to help other women get ahead.</p>\n<p>The point is, your definition of rising is always going to be personal, individual to you. But one of the biggest impediments to rising is also personal and individual: being blind to the behaviors and habits that keep you stuck.</p>\n<p>These behaviors may have worked for you earlier in your career, which is why you may be tempted to cling to them. But as you move higher and assume more responsibility, what got you here&mdash;wherever you are now&mdash;can begin to work against you. This is true for men as well as women, but in our experience, the behaviors that undermine women are often different from the behaviors that undermine men.</p>\n<p>Our focus on behaviors doesn&rsquo;t mean we seek to blame women who have not risen as quickly as they would have liked or that we don&rsquo;t appreciate the role external barriers play in keeping women stuck. Impenetrable old-boys&rsquo; networks, sexist bosses, men who seem incapable of listening to women or who claim credit for their ideas in meetings, career tracks that assume families do not exist, performance review criteria subtly designed to favor men, the unconscious biases that shape hiring and promotion: these impediments are real and unfortunately continue to play a role in stymieing women&rsquo;s advancement.</p>\n<p>Although women have made extraordinary and rapid progress in nearly every sector over the last thirty years, workplace structures and expectations created with men in mind continue to frustrate many women&rsquo;s talents and ambitions. So we repeat: we are not trying to gloss over or deny obstacles that we know are real. However, our primary focus in this&nbsp;book is not on identifying external barriers or providing road maps around them. It&rsquo;s on helping you recognize the behaviors that get in your way as you seek to become more successful on your own terms.</p>\n<p>After all, your behaviors lie within your control, whereas external forces like unconscious bias may not. If the executive your boss reports to only feels comfortable talking with men he meets on the golf course, trying to change that will be an exercise in frustration. If your company uses performance criteria that subtly penalize women, you can be a voice for pointing this out and work with HR to explore alternatives, but it&rsquo;s difficult to persuade your company to immediately jettison how it evaluates performance.</p>\n<p>However, uprooting an unhelpful habit, behavior, or attitude you&rsquo;ve picked up over the course of your working life is the one thing that does lie within your control that can seriously improve your chances of success. At minimum, making the effort should improve your daily experience of work and better prepare you to reach your goals in the future.</p>\n<p>So think of <em>How Women Rise&nbsp;</em>as giving you the means to clear your path of self-imposed obstacles so you can become more successful and take greater satisfaction in your work. Our goal is to help you make the biggest positive difference that <em>you</em>want to make on the path you choose through life.</p>\n<p><strong>How You Define Success</strong><br />\nBefore we get started, we need to clarify what we mean when we talk about success, a word we&rsquo;ll be using quite a lot in this book. In our experience, women often define success a bit differently than men. This means they also define success differently than organizations have traditionally expected people (primarily men) to define success.</p>\n<p>Instead of viewing money and position as the sole or even chief markers of success, women also tend to place a high value on the quality of their lives at work and the impact of their contributions. Enjoying co&#8209;workers and clients, having some degree of control over their time, and believing that their work makes a positive difference in the world are key motivators for many successful women.</p>\n<p>This does not mean women don&rsquo;t care about financial reward or position&mdash;<em>not&nbsp;</em><em>at all</em>. If women believe they are underpaid or feel their position in the organization doesn&rsquo;t reflect the level of their contribution, they will resent it. And this will certainly impact their commitment and their perception of success. After all, money and position are still the carrots companies use to reward people and recognize their value. And most of us work because we need or want money.</p>\n<p>However, one reason organizations sometimes struggle to retain high-performing women is that they operate on the presumption that high salary and high position will always be sufficient motivators <em>even if the quality of work life is consistently low</em>. This assumption, especially when it comes to women, is often wrong. In fact, women are more likely to leave jobs that offer a high salary and position but a low quality of life. They often report finding such jobs &ldquo;not worth it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>These are not wild generalizations. We are basing our observations on decades of experience, as well as on hard data.</p>\n<p>For example, Sally and her colleague Julie Johnson joined with Harris Interactive, the polling company, to conduct a study of similarities and differences in how men and women perceive, define, and pursue satisfaction at work. The results appeared in their book, <em>The Female Vision: Women&rsquo;s Real Power at Work.</em></p>\n<p>The survey, which was delivered to 818 men and women who held management positions in companies with more than fifty employees, found many similarities between men and women. For example, both men and women reported deriving great satisfaction from leading teams, posting results that exceeded expectations, and being recognized for their contributions.</p>\n<p>But the survey also indicated that men tended to place greater value on attaining a high position and earning a high salary, whereas women placed a higher value on the actual experience of work. Earning an excellent salary or achieving a top position did not feel as satisfying to women <em>if they were unable to also enjoy their days</em>. Not every day, of course. But enough to make the job feel worth it.</p>\n<p>Men not only tended to view position and salary as more important than women do, they were more likely to judge themselves (and others) based on these measures. Sally and Marshall have both seen how this form of comparing can lead successful men to underinvest in key relationships, such as family, friends, and community, even though these relationships have consistently been shown to be essential components of human happiness and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Sally and Julie&rsquo;s research also found that men placed a greater value than women on winning, viewing it as a significant source of satisfaction and a key marker of success. They enjoyed besting competitors, &ldquo;running up the score,&rdquo; and often assigned a numeric value or rank to their contributions and achievements. Women, by contrast, took less satisfaction in competition and scorekeeping and often went out of their way to describe winning as the result of a collaborative endeavor. Whereas men were more likely to describe themselves as &ldquo;playing to win,&rdquo; women were more likely to agree with the statement &ldquo;I will pick up the slack for others to assure that a project is successful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Marshall&rsquo;s decades of experience working with successful leaders confirm these findings. When he was interviewed for the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, he was asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the biggest challenge of the many successful leaders you have met?&rdquo; His answer: &ldquo;Winning too much!&rdquo; As Alan Mulally, one of Marshall&rsquo;s heroes, observes, &ldquo;For the great individual achiever, it is all about me. For the great leader, it is all about them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The transition from achiever to leader can be particularly hard for highly competitive men, who may have difficulty recognizing that, as leader, their job is to make everyone else a winner. Women are less likely to struggle with this transition. Although many of the women Marshall and Sally have worked with like to win, they tend to be less interested in winning for themselves than in helping their organizations or their teams win.</p>\n<p>This reluctance to view money, position, and winning as chief arbiters of success is psychologically healthy for women and great for their teams and organizations. But it can have a dark side, leading women to underinvest in their own success even as they devote time to building up others. This instinct for self-sacrifice also lies at the bottom of a number of behaviors that hold women back.</p>\n<p>As you will see, the trick to maximizing your talents and opportunities is not becoming a less thoughtful and giving person, but rather being purposeful and intentional about your choices while also addressing the behaviors that keep you stuck.</p>",

And I don&rsquo;t mean just parts of the system -- we cannot stop until every construct of this normal, every bias, every discriminatory law, and harmful norm is replaced with equality for all. Until every obstacle is leveled, and every ceiling is smashed.</p>\n<p>We all have the power to stand up against the status quo and push back against what we&rsquo;ve come to accept as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>1) &nbsp;Unlearn What &ldquo;Ideal&rdquo; Leadership Looks Like.</strong><br />\nNormal is men and boys leading and women and girls following. It&rsquo;s entrenched and outdated policies and practices that systematically exclude women and girls from leadership roles. Normal is unspoken and unconscious barriers that prevent women and girls&rsquo; access to the skills or experience needed to access seats of leadership.</p>\n<p>Over generations, the normalizing of exclusionary structures has only served to reiterate the prevailing and innate bias toward male leadership.</p>\n<p>We need to redefine and reimagine leadership. As it exists now, it is a product of the exclusionary system that created it. We need to stop trying to make women fit into molds made for and by others and start re-shaping the system to better elevate women of all diversities and backgrounds. Trailblazers like Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand Prime Minister who recently gave birth while serving in office, or Michelle Phan, the first woman to build a $500 million company from a web series, are helping defy the norms of what leadership looks like.</p>\n<p>Despite what gender stereotypes may tell us, women just like men, can excel at leadership. They do it every day at home, in their personal lives, and at work.&nbsp; They are not afraid to ask for help when needed and surround themselves with people that can support them.</p>\n<p>Leadership under women may look different than leadership under men. We need to stop seeing different as bad. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fact is that dismantling traditional norms of leadership is beneficial to everyone, including men.

Adolescent girls in particular are in an incredibly important yet fragile position. They are deeply impacted by the decisions leaders make, yet too often normal for them means being disregarded in important discussions.</p>\n<p>But young people, and especially young girl activists, are defying this normal. One of the most important truths I have learned as CEO &amp; President of Plan International Canada is the awesome and unstoppable power of youth to change our world.&nbsp; They are also the leaders of today.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ve got this. What they need from us is our support, belief and hope.</p>\n<p>Does your workplace have a youth advisory council? If the answer is no &ndash; here are three reasons why you&rsquo;re missing out:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Youth are better able to resist one of the most toxic and unproductive forces of the 21<sup>st</sup> century: cynicism. Driven by optimism and hope they can cut through the noise and shape conversations in meaningful and authentic ways.</li>\n <li>Youth are more willing to challenge systems that aren&rsquo;t working for everyone and create something new where everyone has the opportunity to unleash their human potential. Something deeply rooted in equality, openness and optimism.</li>\n <li>Youth are redefining the future every day. You and your company don&rsquo;t have to watch these shifts from the sidelines, you can play a role in redefining normal by supporting and engaging youth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To all the business and civic leaders reading this, I call on you to commit to supporting youth, whether in your community or in a community half way around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Don&rsquo;t Accumulate Power, Give It Away.</strong><br />\nNormal is the powerful only having a voice, while &nbsp;those without power often watch from the sidelines. Normal is the when vulnerable voices aren&rsquo;t given a platform. But if the #MeToo movement has taught us anything, it is the power of breaking silence with stories.</p>\n<p>We need to stop thinking of vulnerable and excluded women and girls simply as beneficiaries of change, but instead as change agents with stories and solutions to share.</p>\n<p>Wherever possible, my organization is committed to building agency and helping to unleash the potential and power of women and girls. I believe in creating platforms for telling and promoting the stories of those who have not traditionally had a platform from which to speak.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s time for us to help raise up new voices, new narratives and new visions of our shared future, and our normal. The best way to do this is by sharing your power.</p>\n<p>This goes beyond simply empowering people. It is means truly shifting long-held power dynamics and imbalances, so everyone can thrive, not just a few. I promise you that you will see remarkable results, as these individuals will undoubtedly offer up new and innovative solutions and ideas to some of your organization&rsquo;s biggest challenges. &nbsp;This will ultimately mean a better world and more equality for everyone.</p>\n<p>My goal is to inspire Canadians to build a future where we can all enjoy power with each other, rather than power over each other, and where everyone can draw strength from the power within themselves.</p>\n<p>When we reach this goal, there is no limit to what our organizations, Canada, and even the world can accomplish.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>What does leadership look like in 2018?</strong><br />\nAre leaders still believed? Are leaders still trusted? The obvious answer is, &ldquo;of course!&rdquo; Just look at the health of the market, the economy and how one business, in particular, crossed the financial threshold into the trillion dollar market valuation (well done, Apple). On the other hand, stop and think about the divisive state of politics, the news, the global economy and the changes shifting us away from a more connected and open world, to one of nationalism and &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take care of our own first.&rdquo;&nbsp;With all of these strange shifts (it does seem like we&rsquo;re talking out of both sides of our mouth), the leaders of today not only have to deal with the economics and politics at work, but must dig deeper, and find more reason and meaning for their team to pull it together, show up, stand out and make a difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Leadership is about more than nurturing a team and contributing true economic value to the corporation.</strong><br />\nOur world of disruption, innovation and transformation is less about the technology that we&rsquo;re deploying (and the people who make it happen), and much more about getting back to what Simon Sinek has defined as &ldquo;the why?&rdquo; As more and more leaders begin to think about the true corporate &ldquo;why?,&rdquo; and how the culture of the team will (and must) adapt as our business world changes, there is - perhaps - something bigger to think about: How can we, as a brand, truly open up more. Not just to our consumers, but to our team as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Take a principled approach. Read Ray Dalio&rsquo;s Principles.</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s a big book, it&rsquo;s a deep book and it&rsquo;s a counter-intuitive book to how most businesses operate today. These principles worked for Ray Dalio (founder of&nbsp;Bridgewater Associates, which, over the last forty years, has become the largest and best performing hedge fund in the world). What&rsquo;s most striking about the book, Principles - Life &amp; Work (and how Bridgewater grew) is their unprecedented transparency (you can also learn about how radical it truly was in his TED Talk: How to build a company where the best ideas win). While Dalio encourages every organization (and individual) to pursue this route, there was a bigger theme (for me, personally) that emerged from the book that every organization (and individual) can focus on...</p>\n<p><strong>Make visible that which is hidden.</strong><br />\nData, business process, human resources, technology implementations, sales, marketing, professional development, internal meetings, team performance, and the list goes on. There are countless areas where leaders can make significant changes and advances, simply by making visible (to all) that which is hidden (to most). A great (and public) example would be MLS (aka Multiple Listing Service) for the residential real estate market. Think back before this platform existed. If an individual wanted to buy a home, they would speak to a realtor (usually referred by a family member or friend). This realtor held all of the available MLS information in a black box. More often than not, consumers would only hear of homes that the real estate agent was personally listing (which may be expanded to other agents in their office, or agents that the consumer&rsquo;s agent was friends with). It was hard (almost impossible) to get a pulse for how many homes were on the market, their prices and more. The agents guarded this information. While the real estate industry may still have agents that don&rsquo;t like the disruptive force of MLS, the industry continues to roll along. Consumers don&rsquo;t just feel more empowered in their own home ownership journey, they are having more open and honest conversations with their agents, because there is less being hidden from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not just an open market.</strong><br />\nA former Google employee once told me that everyone who worked at company can see very specific information about every teammate on their internal platform. There was even an area that had each Googler&rsquo;s presentation skills rated. Rated not just on how this individual does in the room, but ranked in relation to every other Googler. By making that (usually) hidden information visible, teams for pitches and presentations could get sorted in a much more efficient way. A strategic by-product of this ranking, was that Googler&rsquo;s with a higher rating would often get called for external presentations (to clients or industry events) and this would heighten their visibility within Google, and to their industry. A helpful bump to one&rsquo;s professional development.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A chance to make visible that which is hidden is available to one and all.</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s a great question for every leader to ask: What is hidden that we can make visible? It can be asked today. Even if it is answered and resolved, it can be asked again next month, next quarter, and every year. There is always more. Companies always have these incredible pockets of information, talent and value that sits hidden and/or dormant (to a certain degree). As the French would say: \"ouvre la fenetre!&rdquo; Open the window. Let the sun shine in. Let the people walking by see what&rsquo;s inside. Take a look around. Which companies have made visible that which is hidden, and how did that work out for them? Leaders lead. That is the job. Leaders clearing the path, not just for the rest of the team (and the bottom line) to succeed, but to set the business on a course that allows it to thrive (not just survive) in these hyper-competitive (and different) times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Let this be the leadership battlecry from this day forward: Make visible that which is hidden!</em></p>",

On the other hand, stop and think about the divisive state of politics, the news, the global economy and the changes shifting us away from a more connected and open world, to one of nationalism and &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take care of our own first.&rdquo;&nbsp;With all of these strange shifts (it does seem like we&rsquo;re talking out of both sides of our mouth), the leaders of today not only have to deal with the economics and politics at work, but must dig deeper, and find more reason and meaning for their team to pull it together, show up, stand out and make a difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Leadership is about more than nurturing a team and contributing true economic value to the corporation.</strong><br />\nOur world of disruption, innovation and transformation is less about the technology that we&rsquo;re deploying (and the people who make it happen), and much more about getting back to what Simon Sinek has defined as &ldquo;the why?&rdquo; As more and more leaders begin to think about the true corporate &ldquo;why?,&rdquo; and how the culture of the team will (and must) adapt as our business world changes, there is - perhaps - something bigger to think about: How can we, as a brand, truly open up more. Not just to our consumers, but to our team as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Take a principled approach. Read Ray Dalio&rsquo;s Principles.</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s a big book, it&rsquo;s a deep book and it&rsquo;s a counter-intuitive book to how most businesses operate today. These principles worked for Ray Dalio (founder of&nbsp;Bridgewater Associates, which, over the last forty years, has become the largest and best performing hedge fund in the world). What&rsquo;s most striking about the book, Principles - Life &amp; Work (and how Bridgewater grew) is their unprecedented transparency (you can also learn about how radical it truly was in his TED Talk: How to build a company where the best ideas win). While Dalio encourages every organization (and individual) to pursue this route, there was a bigger theme (for me, personally) that emerged from the book that every organization (and individual) can focus on...</p>\n<p><strong>Make visible that which is hidden.</strong><br />\nData, business process, human resources, technology implementations, sales, marketing, professional development, internal meetings, team performance, and the list goes on. There are countless areas where leaders can make significant changes and advances, simply by making visible (to all) that which is hidden (to most). A great (and public) example would be MLS (aka Multiple Listing Service) for the residential real estate market. Think back before this platform existed. If an individual wanted to buy a home, they would speak to a realtor (usually referred by a family member or friend). This realtor held all of the available MLS information in a black box. More often than not, consumers would only hear of homes that the real estate agent was personally listing (which may be expanded to other agents in their office, or agents that the consumer&rsquo;s agent was friends with). It was hard (almost impossible) to get a pulse for how many homes were on the market, their prices and more. The agents guarded this information. While the real estate industry may still have agents that don&rsquo;t like the disruptive force of MLS, the industry continues to roll along. Consumers don&rsquo;t just feel more empowered in their own home ownership journey, they are having more open and honest conversations with their agents, because there is less being hidden from them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not just an open market.</strong><br />\nA former Google employee once told me that everyone who worked at company can see very specific information about every teammate on their internal platform. There was even an area that had each Googler&rsquo;s presentation skills rated. Rated not just on how this individual does in the room, but ranked in relation to every other Googler. By making that (usually) hidden information visible, teams for pitches and presentations could get sorted in a much more efficient way. A strategic by-product of this ranking, was that Googler&rsquo;s with a higher rating would often get called for external presentations (to clients or industry events) and this would heighten their visibility within Google, and to their industry. A helpful bump to one&rsquo;s professional development.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A chance to make visible that which is hidden is available to one and all.</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s a great question for every leader to ask: What is hidden that we can make visible? It can be asked today. Even if it is answered and resolved, it can be asked again next month, next quarter, and every year. There is always more. Companies always have these incredible pockets of information, talent and value that sits hidden and/or dormant (to a certain degree). As the French would say: \"ouvre la fenetre!&rdquo; Open the window. Let the sun shine in. Let the people walking by see what&rsquo;s inside. Take a look around. Which companies have made visible that which is hidden, and how did that work out for them? Leaders lead. That is the job. Leaders clearing the path, not just for the rest of the team (and the bottom line) to succeed, but to set the business on a course that allows it to thrive (not just survive) in these hyper-competitive (and different) times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Let this be the leadership battlecry from this day forward: Make visible that which is hidden!</em></p>"

      "description": "<p>Technology is transforming business. You can&rsquo;t pick up a magazine or journal today without finding at least one article dedicated to the major shift in the way business and technology interact.

First, ensure you have a great technology partner to guide you through this transformation so you don&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to make your business more profitable and serve your customers better. Second, and with equal importance, don&rsquo;t lose sight of the human side of your business &ndash; it&rsquo;s what will help you build and maintain a culture that supports transformation now and in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Your people are still the backbone.</strong><br />\nThe right technology partner can help you keep your business agile through digital transformation, but that&rsquo;s only one part of the equation. Your culture needs to support that transformation, and the way to build that culture is to lead with emotional intelligence.</p>\n<p>Emotional intelligence is defined as <em>&ldquo;The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one&rsquo;s emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically&rdquo;.</em></p>\n<p>This is key to leadership success and you&rsquo;ll notice that all great leaders follow this. It&rsquo;s about mastering interpersonal relationships and empowering your team, inspiring them to take calculated risks and do their best work. None of this can happen if you don&rsquo;t nurture the relationship, just as you would with a customer.</p>\n<p><strong>Celebrate their uniqueness.</strong><br />\nAs long as you have hired people who are aligned with your organization&rsquo;s goals and values, their personalities and approaches can be completely different. In fact, that&rsquo;s something you should encourage because a diversity of approaches will help you reach a broader market. You can be the glue that holds it all together by doing your job: ensuring that your team members fully understand the strategy and goals, especially during times of transformation. If they don&rsquo;t end up reaching those goals, then you haven&rsquo;t set them up for success by communicating the strategy clearly enough.</p>\n<p>At Dell EMC Canada, our goal is to help customers leverage new technologies to drive revenue, reduce costs, and become more efficient. Our teams are aligned with this goal, and we trust them to achieve it using their own unique approaches. In fact, your ability to trust your team plays a huge part in your organization&rsquo;s success. Organizations built on a culture of trust are far more likely to thrive and scale. This is why it&rsquo;s a major part of our philosophy and we nurture it every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Embrace a realistic approach.</strong><br />\nEmotional intelligence also comes into play when dealing with individual successes and drawbacks. When you promote someone, encourage them to be themselves in their new role. You didn&rsquo;t promote them so they could fill someone else&rsquo;s shoes. You promoted them because they bring something unique to the table. As they gain more experience in the position, they will evolve. And on the flipside, if you&rsquo;re trying to motivate someone to do better, don&rsquo;t try to mold them with robotic corporate rhetoric &ndash; talk to them and find out what might be affecting their work. In other words: Be real!</p>\n<p>Sometimes as leaders we can be tempted to fall back on&nbsp;knee-jerk reactions to successes and failures. Both come along with taking risks, which is an essential part of driving business growth. Risk-taking is both encouraged and valued here at Dell EMC Canada, because you can&rsquo;t learn or grow without it. This is where the control part of emotional intelligence comes in. To be an effective leader, you need to have a sense of realism. One of our favourite mantras here at Dell EMC Canada is: &ldquo;Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems&rdquo;. Celebrate successes but not too much or you could be blindsided when they don&rsquo;t last. There&rsquo;s always something to improve. And when things go south, don&rsquo;t nitpick everything your team is doing wrong &ndash; take a genuine interest in learning how you can help them do better. Dell EMC has another great mantra that speaks to this very well: &ldquo;Pleased but never satisfied&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>We&rsquo;re all in this together.</strong><br />\nGood leaders know that when you care about your customers, they&rsquo;ll reward you with a fruitful, long-term relationship. The same can be said for your team. While artificial intelligence and machine learning make their way into our world, we shouldn&rsquo;t surrender our humanity. It&rsquo;s your responsibility as a leader to add your personal flare, treat your team like individuals, and trust their individual approaches. In turn, they&rsquo;ll be motivated to work hard for you.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you can embrace a digital transformation wholeheartedly, but if you don&rsquo;t lead with emotional intelligence, you could lose the backbone of your business. Find a balance between both and&nbsp;you can build a&nbsp;resilient organization that survives and thrives through the next industrial revolution.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>There's no point in putting something on a to-do list and no doing it. Instead, keep the list under 10 items. Five is even better.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The internet is full of tips for making&nbsp;people more efficient. You could procrastinate for weeks by reading such articles, or books on how to be more productive. Since I write about these topics, I&rsquo;ve waded through a lot of the literature. Some is not terribly useful. I doubt anyone will change their lives by writing &ldquo;K&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;OK&rdquo; in emails.</p>\n<p>But there are a few strategies that I use in my life, over and over again, because I find they make time and life feel so much better and more doable. Here are my favorite seven:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Plan your weeks on Fridays.&nbsp;</strong><br />\nThis tactic is really two ideas combined into one. The first realization is that life is lived in weeks &mdash; 168 hours &mdash; so the best unit of time to plan for&nbsp;is the week. All sorts of things can fit in 168 hours that can&rsquo;t fit in 24. As for Friday? It&rsquo;s best to think through your weeks before you&rsquo;re in them, so you can take a step back and ask what matters and what doesn&rsquo;t. On Friday afternoons, plan out your most important professional and personal priorities for the next week, and see where these items can go.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Measure what matters.&nbsp;</strong><br />\nKeeping an honest inventory of anything that matters in your life can hold you accountable, and nudge you toward your goals. Want to read more? Keep a list of books read. You&rsquo;ll relish seeing it grow. Want to exercise more? Record your workouts. As you see progress &mdash; running faster, lifting heavier weights &mdash; you&rsquo;ll feel motivated to keep going.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Figure out three &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; events for the weekend.</strong><br />\nSince I have&nbsp;four kids and a house to manage, it would be easy for my weekends to be taken over by chores and children&rsquo;s activities. To make sure I still enjoy myself &mdash; and feel rejuvenated for Monday &mdash; I make sure to plan in three activities that will add to my energy levels. Sometimes these things involve my children (a family bike ride, or trip to an indoor pool in winter). Sometimes they don&rsquo;t (dinner out with my husband, an adults-only party, reading 100 pages in a good book). In any case, making a plan and figuring out the logistics ahead of time vastly increases the chances that these things happen, and that the weekend feels both full and good.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Tackle the toughest work first.</strong><br />\nMost people have more discipline and focus early in the day. Scheduling in important tasks early means you&rsquo;ll be more likely to have the energy to do them. They&rsquo;ll take a lot less time than if you wait until that mid-afternoon slump (at which point you&rsquo;ll keep getting distracted, re-reading the same emails and checking headlines, until panic sets in and you realize you&rsquo;ll be working late again.)</p>\n<p><strong>5. Use bits of time well.</strong><br />\nIf you have 5-10 minutes before a phone call starts, you could surf the web or delete email newsletters you can&rsquo;t remember subscribing to. Or you could read a few pages in a book (perhaps on ebook on your phone). You could also use this time to meditate, write in a journal, plan your weekend. Deleting emails feels productive, but it isn&rsquo;t really. Use this time for something more meaningful instead.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Make very short to-do lists.</strong><br />\nMaking a daily to-do list is a sensible idea. The trouble is that people make endless to-do lists. If there are 50 items on a list, you won&rsquo;t do all of them, and then you&rsquo;ll feel bad. There&rsquo;s no point in putting something on a to-do list and not doing it. Instead, keep the list under 10 items. Five is even better. Stuff comes up, as it always does, so revisit the list toward the end of the day to make sure you&rsquo;re on track. A 4 p.m. &ldquo;triage&rdquo; of your list can help you make sure you do anything that has to happen by the end of the day early enough to leave on time.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Have a bed time.</strong><br />\nI aim to be in bed around 11 p.m. these days. It doesn&rsquo;t always happen, but if I wake up between 6-6:30 a.m., I&rsquo;ll feel well-rested. Giving yourself a bedtime provides a nudge to make a decision. You can blow past your bedtime &mdash; you are an adult after all &mdash; but you have to choose. If there&rsquo;s no good reason to stay up, you might as well go to bed. Your morning self will thank you.</p>",

(Hint: where in the table below do you fall, left or right column?)</li>\n <li>What value are you truly creating in your job today?</li>\n <li>What new and additional value do you think you can create in your job? Every employee must have a precise definition of value as it relates to his or her role.&nbsp;While I have provided some examples of value creation, there isn&rsquo;t enough space here to go into details. To learn more and gain a deeper understanding, I invite you to check out Chapter 3 in my book&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.mortenhansen.com/book/great-at-work/\">Great at Work.</a></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/images/morten%20hansen%20chart.jpg\" style=\"width: 950px; height: 703px;\" /></em></p>"

      "summary": "<p>Body language is usually the telltale sign of whether someone is lying or not. But sometimes we fall prey to the myths of reading body language. Mark Bowden and Tracey Thomson tell us how to better read our teams.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Some people feel they are &ldquo;a natural&rdquo; at reading other people&rsquo;s body language. They have &ldquo;the gift.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an instinct. You may be one of them. And so sometimes you just know when someone is lying to you. Family, friends and in the workplace you get the feeling they are not being truly honest with you, and you act accordingly. Sometimes you may be right on the money, while other times you may end up wondering &ldquo;how did I read that so wrong?&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe reality is that judging accurately the thoughts that inform someone else&rsquo;s behavior, including the intent to deceive, is less of an art and more of a way of thinking; and that critical thinking process that gets you closer to the truth can be learned. In TRUTH &amp; LIES: What People Are Really Thinking, Mark Bowden &amp; Tracey Thomson teach you a system to better understand human behavior and the nonverbal communication that goes with it, that revolves around a critical thinking element that helps you suspend your judgement and get closer to the all the accurate facts - and arrive at the most likely truth of any situation. Part of that process is suspending our instinctive judgements and investigating the bias we may have.<br />\n<br />\nMany of our judgements about what body language cues mean, though they feel to us so instinctive and obvious, are actually learned ideas and so not in fact pure or innate. These ideas are often based on folklore that has become accepted as fact, that we pick up from family, friends, colleagues and from the media- clickbait that feels so right and true, but can actually be dangerously false.<br />\n<br />\nHere are just 3 of the many popular myths around the body language of lying that are bustin in TRUTH &amp; LIES: What People Are Really Thinking:<br />\n<br />\nMYTH: Fidgeters Are Hiding Something<br />\n<br />\nFiddling with your hands for no apparent reason may be the displacement of emotions and thoughts that are unexpressed, anything from excitement or boredom to frustration or relief. It can be a self-pacifying behavior where the physical movement creates a stimulus that calms us in times of anxiety. Or it can just be a way to shift parts of the body to make us more comfortable after being still for too long. In no way can it be seen as a sure indicator of deceit. Besides, if someone really wanted to hide something from you, don&rsquo;t you think they would be able to control their hands for just a while to get away with it? Without this ability, poker players couldn&rsquo;t bluff. Undercover cops would be instantly exposed.

The idea that looking to the right indicates lying, while looking left suggests truth-telling, is shown by research to be false. The University of Edinburgh completed three studies to show there is no definitive correlation between the direction of eye movement and whether the subject was telling the truth or lying (1).

Well, there&rsquo;s a good reason that the story of Pinocchio is a fairytale. You cannot actually tell if someone is lying based on just one body language sign. And to this end, the idea that people touch their noses when they are telling a lie is largely folklore. In fact, the idea that the nose alone can display subtle telltale signs of lying is pure fantasy. However, wrinkling the nose in disgust, if detected alongside other signals, could certainly indicate a deceitful person smelling their own rat of a lie, such as flaring nostrils as part of the micro gesture of disgust.<br />\n<br />\nSo next time you feel you have spotted a liar, take a moment to check yourself and think again.

          "textOnly": "<p>Some people feel they are &ldquo;a natural&rdquo; at reading other people&rsquo;s body language. They have &ldquo;the gift.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an instinct. You may be one of them. And so sometimes you just know when someone is lying to you. Family, friends and in the workplace you get the feeling they are not being truly honest with you, and you act accordingly. Sometimes you may be right on the money, while other times you may end up wondering &ldquo;how did I read that so wrong?&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nThe reality is that judging accurately the thoughts that inform someone else&rsquo;s behavior, including the intent to deceive, is less of an art and more of a way of thinking; and that critical thinking process that gets you closer to the truth can be learned. In TRUTH &amp; LIES: What People Are Really Thinking, Mark Bowden &amp; Tracey Thomson teach you a system to better understand human behavior and the nonverbal communication that goes with it, that revolves around a critical thinking element that helps you suspend your judgement and get closer to the all the accurate facts - and arrive at the most likely truth of any situation. Part of that process is suspending our instinctive judgements and investigating the bias we may have.<br />\n<br />\nMany of our judgements about what body language cues mean, though they feel to us so instinctive and obvious, are actually learned ideas and so not in fact pure or innate. These ideas are often based on folklore that has become accepted as fact, that we pick up from family, friends, colleagues and from the media- clickbait that feels so right and true, but can actually be dangerously false.<br />\n<br />\nHere are just 3 of the many popular myths around the body language of lying that are bustin in TRUTH &amp; LIES: What People Are Really Thinking:<br />\n<br />\nMYTH: Fidgeters Are Hiding Something<br />\n<br />\nFiddling with your hands for no apparent reason may be the displacement of emotions and thoughts that are unexpressed, anything from excitement or boredom to frustration or relief. It can be a self-pacifying behavior where the physical movement creates a stimulus that calms us in times of anxiety. Or it can just be a way to shift parts of the body to make us more comfortable after being still for too long. In no way can it be seen as a sure indicator of deceit. Besides, if someone really wanted to hide something from you, don&rsquo;t you think they would be able to control their hands for just a while to get away with it? Without this ability, poker players couldn&rsquo;t bluff. Undercover cops would be instantly exposed. Most relationships would be irreparably damaged forever.<br />\n<br />\nMYTH: Looking Up to the Right Means They're Lying<br />\n<br />\nDoes the direction in which someone&rsquo;s eyes look give away that they are lying?

      "description": "<p>Growing up, Michelle McKenna-Doyle was always a fan of sports, specifically Football. Her passion for football ran in the family. Her father was a devoted fan of legendary quarterback Joe Namath, and her brother accepted a full scholarship to play football at the University of Alabama. Indeed, her father was almost certain he would see his child make it to the NFL one day. And he was right&mdash;it just wasn&rsquo;t his son. McKenna-Doyle&rsquo;s career took a winding path, but eventually she found herself in the Chief Information Officer role for several different Fortune 500 companies.<br />\n<br />\nOne day&mdash;while checking her fantasy football league&mdash;she stumbled upon a job listing on the NFL website and eventually she decided she would apply. But she had no connection to the NFL, so she started exploring her network. The closest lead should could find was a former colleague, who worked for an executive search firm. His company wasn&rsquo;t handling that particular search, but he knew who was and made the introduction. His referral helped Michelle interview with the senior leaders of the league, and got the job as CIO. On the day she started, she had been given the highest office a female executive had ever held in the league. And her father finally got to see one of his children make it in the NFL.<br />\n<br />\nOur tendency when things get tough is to seek out trusted, familiar counsel. When we need a new job, for example, we default to those close to our network. We tell our friends and family, but ironically skip over&nbsp;our weak ties and go right to coldly responding to job postings online. Or when we need advice about a major problem, we tend to only share our dilemma with those close to us&mdash; those we feel comfortable around. But that comfort comes at a cost. Most of the strong ties in our network are connected to each other. They are often so tightly clustered that information known by one person is already known by everyone else in that cluster. In contrast, our weaker connections often build a bridge from one cluster to another and thus give us access to new information&mdash;not unlike McKenna-Doyle&rsquo;s old colleague who now worked in the executive search world. Even though the strong ties in our life are more likely to be motivated to help us, it turns out that weak ties access to new sources of information may be more valuable than the strong ties&rsquo; motivation.<br />\n<br />\nThis counterintuitive finding first came from a now classic study by sociologist Mark Granovetter. In 1970, Granovetter was a PhD student at Harvard University and decided to conduct a study of job transitions. When surveying respondents, he would often ask whether a friend&nbsp;had told them about their current job. So many times, respondents would answer with something like: &ldquo;Not a friend, but an acquaintance,&rdquo; which suggested to Granovetter that he ought to look further. He asked hundreds of people how often they saw those contacts around the time they received the job information. Granovetter used three categories: often (at least twice a week), occasionally (more than once a year but less than twice a week), and rarely (once a year or less). When Granovetter looked at the collected results, he found that less than 17 percent of job changes saw their contacts often. Over 55 percent said they saw their contact occasionally and over 27 percent said rarely. &ldquo;The skew is clearly to the weak end of the continuum,&rdquo; Granvotter wrote in his 1973 paper presenting this data. That paper, &ldquo;The Strength of Weak Ties,&rdquo; would go on to become one of the most cited papers in sociology.<br />\n<br />\nIn that paper, he noticed the role former colleagues and long-lost friends played in helping individuals. &ldquo;Chance meetings or mutual friends operated to reactivate such ties,&rdquo; Granovetter noted. &ldquo;It is remarkable that people receive crucial information from individuals whose very existence they have forgotten.&rdquo; Over time, other researchers would come up with a shorter name for such a weak tie that used to be stronger&mdash;a better name for McKenna-Doyle&rsquo;s old colleague. They would label it a dormant tie and their research would prove just how valuable these weak connections are.<br />\n<br />\nResearchers Daniel Levin, Jorge Walter, and Keith Murningham have been studying the power of dormant ties for almost a decade. Specifically, they have been surveying business executives, encouraging them to deliberately reactivate old connections, and then observing the results. And the results have been quite powerful. In one experiment, the trio asked a group of 224 executives from four executive MBA classes to reconnect with two people to whom they had not spoken for at least three years, but who they think would have advice that would help them on a major work project. Specifically, the executives were to contact one person with whom they had a strong relationship before they fell out of touch, and also with one individual with whom they had a weak tie relationship. In addition, the executives selected two current&nbsp;contacts (one strong, one weak) with whom they had already sought out for advice during the course of their project. The researchers then asked executives to assess all four contacts&rsquo; advice in terms of value (actionable knowledge) novelty, trust, and the extent to which they had a shared perspective.<br />\n<br />\nLike weak ties, dormant ties are a wealth of new, different, and unexpected insights. Our dormant ties are still around and interacting with other social circles and encountering&nbsp;new experiences. But unlike weak ties, many dormant ties were once stronger relationships and because of this, the trust and motivation to help are much stronger than current weak ties. Like the executives studied, and like McKenna-Doyle no doubt felt, reaching out to old colleagues and friends can be uncomfortable, but the&nbsp;pay off is more than worth it. What can make it especially awkward is only reconnecting when the time comes to find that new job or get counsel on a new project. So don&rsquo;t wait. Instead, start today and make reconnecting a habit. Make a list of 4-5 people, just like the executives in the study, and&nbsp;make it a point to reach back out to one per week through email, telephone, or whatever feels best and catch up. Don&rsquo;t have an agenda in mind, just make it a point to reignite the relationship and trust that the value being created will be useful down the road. That&rsquo;ll make the conversation feel less awkward and open you up to new possibilities. If&nbsp;we want to maximize the value of our network, then we need to make sure we are using all of our connections and not limiting ourselves to just our current strong ties. The bottom line is that when it comes to new information and opportunities, our weak and dormant ties are much stronger.</p>",

Things do not have to happen daily, nor do they have to happen at the same time every day in order to count. Believing that they do means falling into what I call the &ldquo;24-Hour Trap.&rdquo; For women in particular, the 24-Hour Trap often leads to pitting work against family.

People tell me all the time that they want to exercise more,&nbsp;and then they talk themselves out of it because there is not a perfect time every single day. Sure it would be great to exercise, but they&rsquo;re not the kinds of people who can leave for an hour at lunch every day. Or they have families they&rsquo;d like to see so they can&rsquo;t go to the gym for an hour every night after work. But who said exercise has to happen daily, or at the same time every day? A better plan might be to look at the whole of the week and see where it can fit in. Maybe that&rsquo;s one early morning a week, one lunch time walk, a class at the gym some night when a partner or relative can cover, then a family bike ride on the weekend. That is four times a week right there. It didn&rsquo;t happen at the same time every day, but it didn&rsquo;t have to.<br />\n<br />\nExercise is certainly important, but I find that the 24-Hour Trap is even more pernicious when it comes to how women balance work and life. Not long ago I got a note from a woman who was facing what she considered a very knotty work/life dilemma. She was newly in management. She needed her team to trust her, and that required spending relaxed time together. Her team sometimes went out for drinks, and she knew she should go sometimes and pick up a round. But she was also a new mom, and so if she went out with her team, she wouldn&rsquo;t be putting her child to bed. She had talked herself into believing this was one of those hard choice moments: work vs. family. Be a good manager, or be a good mom. Women can&rsquo;t have it all!<br />\n<br />\nIt sounds tough, but only from the 24-hour perspective. After all, did her team want her to take them out every single night? Friday, Saturday, and Sunday too? Even if she was an amazing woman, no one wants to hang out with&nbsp;a boss that much! If she took her team out one night a week or so, she&rsquo;d be home the other six nights. Six is greater than one. When she fell into the 24-Hour Trap, she was pitting work against family. Looking at life from the 168- hour (one week) perspective meant she could be the kind of manager who was regularly nurturing her team, and the kind of mother who was there almost every night. She truly could have it all.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIf you find yourself facing a work/ life dilemma, see if broadening your time perspective might change how you see your choices. Rather than racing out of work every night, yet only getting a little bit of time in the evening with your young children, try working very late &mdash; past bedtime &mdash; twice a week, and getting home much earlier on the other three nights.

      "description": "<p><strong>Tell us about Electronic Arts.</strong><br />\nEA is a global leader in interactive entertainment software. We make video games! We deliver games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets. Here in Vancouver, our studio is home to some of the biggest video game franchises in the world such as EA SPORTS FIFA, which was the bestselling video game in 2016. We employ about 1,500 creative and passionate people here at our amazing campus.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Can you tell us a little about yourself and your background, how did you come to work at EA?</strong><br />\nI&rsquo;ve been at EA for 14 years. You could say that I grew up at EA! I joined EA when I graduated from UBC with a Computer Science and Business degree and I began as a junior project manager working in EA SPORTS. Early in my career I had the opportunity to learn on the job and have been fortunate to have many different experiences - from managing the development of pretty much every domain area of a game, to then growing to manage whole game teams, and ultimately to present day where I oversee development of multiple franchises.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is your role there? How many people do you manage</strong><br />\nI am a Sr Director of Product Development overseeing the EA Sports titles being developed in Vancouver, Canada and Bucharest, Romania. I&rsquo;m responsible for the EA SPORTS FIFA, NHL and UFC franchises. Together it&rsquo;s a group of approximately 600 people.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What are some of the unique challenges you face as a leader at Electronic Arts?</strong><br />\nWorking in video games is very exciting and fast paced, but also comes with a variety of unique challenges. One aspect is working with a wide variety of different disciplines and people from diverse backgrounds. The teams at EA are quite large - a typical game team would include software engineers, artists, designers, animators, UX designers, producers, project managers, data analysts, QA testers, business analysts and more. As such, as a leader you need to be constantly adapting your leadership style to account for all the different job families and ensure that everyone is working cohesively as one team! Another unique challenge is that the key quality measurement for video game experiences is something completely intangible - fun. Fundamentally, how do you measure &ldquo;fun&rdquo;? How do we know if the game will be &ldquo;fun&rdquo; in time for launch? In order to &ldquo;find the fun&rdquo;, game development requires constant iteration. And that is definitely the most&nbsp;challenging aspect of developing games. The best thing we can do to overcome that uncertainty is to expect and plan for change, all the time. Making games is not about building the perfect plan and then executing on it. Rather, it is about adapting to a constantly shifting set of requirements and reevaluating our plans all along the way. Balancing this amount of change while ultimately ensuring that the game gets completed to quality, on time and on budget is a true challenge for any leader!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You must have worked with some great leaders over the years! Tell us about some of them and the impact they have had on you.</strong><br />\nI certainly have had the opportunity to work with many great leaders over the years, but the one that stands out the most in my mind is Andrew Wilson who is currently the CEO of EA. Andrew&nbsp;used to run the FIFA franchise and I was one of the managers on his team at the time. He was truly a very inspiring leader, but most of all Andrew made us believe. He made us believe that we were the most important team working on the most important product in all of EA. He saw FIFA as the greatest and best selling video game franchise in history long before any of us did. And with a relentless drive for producing the highest quality of work he led FIFA to the top of the charts where it remains to this day.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is your leadership style? What do you think makes you an effective leader?</strong><br />\nI don&rsquo;t think I have one particular style, so I definitely believe in exercising situational leadership and adjusting my approach based on the situation and the people involved. My style varies greatly; I can be very much in the details as required when I&rsquo;m working on budget submissions or audits of projects, to more of a coach when I&rsquo;m helping another leader grow into their role and new responsibilities, to a more transformational type leader when I&rsquo;m challenging the team to improve our existing process and practices. I think the key to leadership is being self-aware enough to know both your true strengths and weaknesses, open enough to listen to the team around you and humble enough to be willing to learn from your mistakes, adapt and move forward.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What do you look for when you hire for leadership roles into the organization?</strong><br />\nWe hire people with a wide range of professional backgrounds, and although game development would be a strong asset, it&rsquo;s by no means a requirement.<br />\n<br />\nFor senior leaders, we&rsquo;re looking for people with experience running largescale, complex projects and leading large teams. For more junior/entry-level roles, we&rsquo;re looking for those who are passionate and willing to learn. And across all levels, we look for natural leaders with good interpersonal skills, passion and who are strong problemsolvers.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The tech industry has traditionally been fairly male dominated. What has your experience been like as a female leader?</strong><br />\nYes, software development is still a male-dominated field but there are plenty of women at EA as well, and quite a few in senior leadership roles. EA has a strong focus on diversity, where across our organization we strongly believe that in order to make game experiences that appeal to a large array of people we must&nbsp;have as much diversity in our teams as possible. This is not just about women in tech, but being inclusive of all types of diversity. The more diverse our teams are the better our game experiences will be. There&rsquo;s no better example of this than the FIFA team, which has such diverse backgrounds that there are 23 unique languages spoken in the development team. Overall, my entire experience at EA has been tremendously positive and to be honest I have never felt limited or challenged because I&rsquo;m a woman. My career has always felt like it has progressed forward due to my performance and delivering results - EA is a true meritocracy.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Your role carries a great deal of responsibility and must keep you very busy. How do you balance that with your personal life?</strong><br />\nIt can certainly be difficult at times. There have been times when I have really struggled, and still do to a certain extent now as I try to find that right balance. Thankfully, EA is a modern workplace, where I have the flexibility to adjust the hours in the office and occasionally work from home if needed. Also, one of the key things for me was realizing that I need people&rsquo;s help and accepting that help. I am very fortunate to have a true partner in my husband who is incredible supportive and understanding of my job&rsquo;s demands. My parents have also been instrumental in helping with the day-to-day responsibilities of carpools, after school activities and all the fun stuff that comes with having two young kids. I run a very detailed calendar for home - I am a project manager after all - and it takes a lot of planning and communication to keep it all running smoothly!</p>",

          "textOnly": "<p><strong>Tell us about Electronic Arts.</strong><br />\nEA is a global leader in interactive entertainment software. We make video games! We deliver games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets. Here in Vancouver, our studio is home to some of the biggest video game franchises in the world such as EA SPORTS FIFA, which was the bestselling video game in 2016. We employ about 1,500 creative and passionate people here at our amazing campus.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Can you tell us a little about yourself and your background, how did you come to work at EA?</strong><br />\nI&rsquo;ve been at EA for 14 years. You could say that I grew up at EA! I joined EA when I graduated from UBC with a Computer Science and Business degree and I began as a junior project manager working in EA SPORTS. Early in my career I had the opportunity to learn on the job and have been fortunate to have many different experiences - from managing the development of pretty much every domain area of a game, to then growing to manage whole game teams, and ultimately to present day where I oversee development of multiple franchises.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is your role there? How many people do you manage</strong><br />\nI am a Sr Director of Product Development overseeing the EA Sports titles being developed in Vancouver, Canada and Bucharest, Romania. I&rsquo;m responsible for the EA SPORTS FIFA, NHL and UFC franchises. Together it&rsquo;s a group of approximately 600 people.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What are some of the unique challenges you face as a leader at Electronic Arts?</strong><br />\nWorking in video games is very exciting and fast paced, but also comes with a variety of unique challenges. One aspect is working with a wide variety of different disciplines and people from diverse backgrounds. The teams at EA are quite large - a typical game team would include software engineers, artists, designers, animators, UX designers, producers, project managers, data analysts, QA testers, business analysts and more. As such, as a leader you need to be constantly adapting your leadership style to account for all the different job families and ensure that everyone is working cohesively as one team! Another unique challenge is that the key quality measurement for video game experiences is something completely intangible - fun. Fundamentally, how do you measure &ldquo;fun&rdquo;? How do we know if the game will be &ldquo;fun&rdquo; in time for launch? In order to &ldquo;find the fun&rdquo;, game development requires constant iteration. And that is definitely the most&nbsp;challenging aspect of developing games. The best thing we can do to overcome that uncertainty is to expect and plan for change, all the time. Making games is not about building the perfect plan and then executing on it. Rather, it is about adapting to a constantly shifting set of requirements and reevaluating our plans all along the way. Balancing this amount of change while ultimately ensuring that the game gets completed to quality, on time and on budget is a true challenge for any leader!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>You must have worked with some great leaders over the years! Tell us about some of them and the impact they have had on you.</strong><br />\nI certainly have had the opportunity to work with many great leaders over the years, but the one that stands out the most in my mind is Andrew Wilson who is currently the CEO of EA. Andrew&nbsp;used to run the FIFA franchise and I was one of the managers on his team at the time. He was truly a very inspiring leader, but most of all Andrew made us believe. He made us believe that we were the most important team working on the most important product in all of EA. He saw FIFA as the greatest and best selling video game franchise in history long before any of us did. And with a relentless drive for producing the highest quality of work he led FIFA to the top of the charts where it remains to this day.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is your leadership style? What do you think makes you an effective leader?</strong><br />\nI don&rsquo;t think I have one particular style, so I definitely believe in exercising situational leadership and adjusting my approach based on the situation and the people involved. My style varies greatly; I can be very much in the details as required when I&rsquo;m working on budget submissions or audits of projects, to more of a coach when I&rsquo;m helping another leader grow into their role and new responsibilities, to a more transformational type leader when I&rsquo;m challenging the team to improve our existing process and practices.

The research we tapped included our own surveys of more than 850,000 people, which helped us identify the traits of managers of the most successful teams and isolate disciplines that employees indicate are most motivating. Here&rsquo;s a highlight of just three of the disciplines of the best teams and team leaders we found:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Manage to The One</strong><br />\nLack of career development has become the number one reason why employees leave a job&mdash;a change from just a few years ago when pay topped the list. But focusing on career development is a relatively low-cost way to keep team members and keep them engaged, and is well within the control of the leader. We found considerable payoffs in increased passion, creativity and productivity when leaders took even a small amount of time to personalize responsibilities based on team members&rsquo; individual drivers. In many high-engagement teams, we discovered variations on a practice we call job sculpting, in which managers give each employee some work to do that is especially motivating to him/her while altering or transferring other work that might be demotivating (if at all possible). Sounds simple, right, but the payoffs of a formal process like this can be remarkable.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Challenge Everything</strong><br />\nFeeling comfortable to express one&rsquo;s views, take smart risks and being given roughly equal time to speak up are the hallmarks of what&rsquo;s called psychological safety. Our research shows that fostering these characteristics is vital for effective problem-solving and innovative thinking within a fast-moving team. But keeping debate from escalating into dissension and backstabbing, while assuring all team members get a roughly equal hearing, is tricky; thus, we asked great team leaders the methods they use to promote healthy discord. Some of the rules for debate we found on open teams included:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Challenge the position, not the person, and don't make it personal</li>\n <li>Seek to gather facts and do not jump to conclusions</li>\n <li>Come to the debate ready to present data not supposition</li>\n <li>Listen. Remember you are not in a competition to win</li>\n <li>After the team makes a decision collaboratively, we are all going to support it</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Don't Forget the Customer</strong><br />\nIn the most global, diverse, technologically driven workplace in history, any manager who doesn&rsquo;t find time to understand how to work more collaboratively with other functional areas of the business is going to be left behind. But we find the focus of all team efforts must be kept rigorously on customers, whatever they look like. With that as a foundation, turf consciousness begins to diminish. And, as an ancillary benefit, a primary focus on defining who customers are and then empowering employees to truly serve them boosts employee engagement by creating clarity about a team&rsquo;s purpose. Helping others (customers) improve their lives in some way is a much stronger motivator to most of us than abstract business goals of increasing sales, bringing down costs or elevating ROI.</p>",

      "description": "<p>With so much of our lives spent at work, it&rsquo;s no wonder that creating a company culture that excites and stimulates employees is fundamental to attracting and retaining the best talent and building your brand&rsquo;s identity. When Nadine Cole first took over Cossette&rsquo;s western offices, she took a different approach to building up the culture&nbsp;of her team at the integrated marketing and communications agency. The results have been astounding with the region now reporting the highest engagement scores in the network. Since then, she hasn&rsquo;t looked back as the office culture has evolved organically and taken on a life of its own. Here are some lessons to learn from her approach.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Why is Culture Important to you?</strong><br />\nWork is such a big part of your life from a time standpoint, you really should be passionate about it. I want my team to wake up feeling driven and excited about what they are going to accomplish at work that day and I know that we as a company need to play a pivotal role in creating the best environment possible. It&rsquo;s about investing in people, not just on a work level but as individuals.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do a positive culture and a strong employee engagement impact the success of a business?</strong><br />\nThey impact energy thus output in its simplest form. Those who are engaged are more invested in what Cossette is about, and this translates to their accountability and the quality of work they produce. When people feel valued and happy in their role, you can see it in their productivity and the quality of their work. Not only are they more likely to stay and grow with the company in the long term, but they will also become ambassadors for your brand, helping to build up your company&rsquo;s reputation and attract new talent and business through word-of-mouth referrals.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tell us about what makes your offices special.</strong><br />\nWhen I first took on the leadership role, we had just completed a reorganization where the majority of staff moved into a newly created company. I had 21 staff from four different disciplines and one key client. I made it a priority to build our culture up from scratch by engineering events and activities to bring people together. At first it was just two of us leading the charge, but eventually it turned into something organic and took on a life of its own.<br />\n<br />\nNow we have a whole team of people who meet regularly to map out an annual calendar of events and initiatives that meet the needs of our 60 employees. Balance is important&mdash; it&rsquo;s not just about parties&mdash;so we take a strategic approach to ensure a healthy mix of social, community outreach, creative, personal growth, and training sessions are considered.<br />\n<br />\nSome of our creative initiatives include an annual Talent Show and a Cossette Film Fest, where people can create their own short films complete with movie posters and a screening event. Something we&rsquo;re really proud of is our creative C project where people can pitch an idea that they don&rsquo;t have the resources to implement on their own. The best ideas receive up to $5,000 in funding to support people in their passions outside of these four walls.<br />\n<br />\nA while back some of the team also expressed a desire to do more to give back, so Cossette Karma, our community outreach committee, was created and is now a thriving initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you put your own personal stamp on your team's culture?</strong><br />\nI participate in everything&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s a Halloween costume contest or team building activity&mdash;and really give it my all. Even if I don&rsquo;t always feel like it, it means a lot for me to play a big role in our company culture. You can&rsquo;t expect culture to happen if you don&rsquo;t show up or lead by example. It leaves an impression on people.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you keep your employees motivated and engaged in the company?</strong><br />\nWe run three surveys a year to collect anonymous feedback from our staff. This allows us to measure engagement year over year. It&rsquo;s imperative that as many people as possible participate in these surveys&mdash;otherwise their perspective cannot be taken into account&nbsp;when implementing change&mdash;so we strive for and often receive 100 percent participation.<br />\n<br />\nOnce all responses are collected, I hold an all-agency meeting to go through the feedback with a focus on the top three areas for improvement&nbsp;(based on recurring themes). The office is then broken up into smaller groups to develop solutions, which they then present back to the wider group. This approach gives everyone a voice to drive change as it is the collective who vote on what goes forward.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Have you ever had a mentor who modelled effective company culture, which you now emulate in your own leadership style?</strong><br />\nDuring my early years at Cossette, I was fortunate to have M&eacute;lanie Dunn, our now Global President and CEO, as my mentor. While we didn&rsquo;t work out of the same office, M&eacute;lanie always made time for me. We had a standing monthly call and once a quarter we would get together and Melanie would let me shadow her for a full day. Seeing her interact with our colleagues at all levels taught me that an effective leadership structure is not hierarchical, but flat and collaborative. Melanie's empathy and open-door policy laid the foundation for my own leadership style, which is reflected in my approach to our company culture.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What are your top three do's and don'ts for leaders looking to build their organization's culture?</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>DO'S</strong><br />\n<br />\n1. STRUCTURE IT RIGHT.<br />\nBe strategic when building the base of your organization&rsquo;s cultural initiatives. Provide direction and get the right people involved as ambassadors to drive organic growth. Support initiatives that relate to your company values.<br />\n<br />\n2. PARTICIPATE.<br />\nJoin in fully...but know when to leave. As the leader, it&rsquo;s important to show up to events and stay for a respectful amount of time but also leave early enough so people can let loose.<br />\n<br />\n3. BE TRANSPARENT.<br />\nTransparency is key not only to employee engagement but also company culture. Leaders should be open and honest about both the good and the bad of their organization (financials included). Your team will pick up on the negatives whether you choose to share them or not, and an honest approach will help to build longterm trust.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>DONT'S</strong><br />\n<br />\n1. DON&rsquo;T KIBOSH IDEAS.<br />\nSet some parameters for your team to work within, but don&rsquo;t define each detail. If there&rsquo;s something that doesn&rsquo;t work from the onset, let your team run with it. Trust that they will find a solution.<br />\n<br />\n2. DON&rsquo;T CLOSE YOUR DOOR.<br />\nBe approachable and make time for people. Your time is worth its weight in gold. Closed doors should only be for private calls or confidential meetings.<br />\n<br />\n3. DON&rsquo;T ASK FOR FEEDBACK IF YOU DON&rsquo;T INTEND TO ACT ON IT.<br />\nIf you ask your team questions and collect data on how to improve your company&rsquo;s culture, then you need to act on it. If you don&rsquo;t, then don&rsquo;t bother&mdash;it will impact you more negatively in the long run.</p>",

The best ideas receive up to $5,000 in funding to support people in their passions outside of these four walls.<br />\n<br />\nA while back some of the team also expressed a desire to do more to give back, so Cossette Karma, our community outreach committee, was created and is now a thriving initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you put your own personal stamp on your team's culture?</strong><br />\nI participate in everything&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s a Halloween costume contest or team building activity&mdash;and really give it my all. Even if I don&rsquo;t always feel like it, it means a lot for me to play a big role in our company culture. You can&rsquo;t expect culture to happen if you don&rsquo;t show up or lead by example. It leaves an impression on people.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How do you keep your employees motivated and engaged in the company?</strong><br />\nWe run three surveys a year to collect anonymous feedback from our staff. This allows us to measure engagement year over year. It&rsquo;s imperative that as many people as possible participate in these surveys&mdash;otherwise their perspective cannot be taken into account&nbsp;when implementing change&mdash;so we strive for and often receive 100 percent participation.<br />\n<br />\nOnce all responses are collected, I hold an all-agency meeting to go through the feedback with a focus on the top three areas for improvement&nbsp;(based on recurring themes). The office is then broken up into smaller groups to develop solutions, which they then present back to the wider group. This approach gives everyone a voice to drive change as it is the collective who vote on what goes forward.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Have you ever had a mentor who modelled effective company culture, which you now emulate in your own leadership style?</strong><br />\nDuring my early years at Cossette, I was fortunate to have M&eacute;lanie Dunn, our now Global President and CEO, as my mentor. While we didn&rsquo;t work out of the same office, M&eacute;lanie always made time for me. We had a standing monthly call and once a quarter we would get together and Melanie would let me shadow her for a full day. Seeing her interact with our colleagues at all levels taught me that an effective leadership structure is not hierarchical, but flat and collaborative. Melanie's empathy and open-door policy laid the foundation for my own leadership style, which is reflected in my approach to our company culture.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What are your top three do's and don'ts for leaders looking to build their organization's culture?</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>DO'S</strong><br />\n<br />\n1. STRUCTURE IT RIGHT.<br />\nBe strategic when building the base of your organization&rsquo;s cultural initiatives. Provide direction and get the right people involved as ambassadors to drive organic growth. Support initiatives that relate to your company values.<br />\n<br />\n2. PARTICIPATE.<br />\nJoin in fully...but know when to leave. As the leader, it&rsquo;s important to show up to events and stay for a respectful amount of time but also leave early enough so people can let loose.<br />\n<br />\n3. BE TRANSPARENT.<br />\nTransparency is key not only to employee engagement but also company culture. Leaders should be open and honest about both the good and the bad of their organization (financials included). Your team will pick up on the negatives whether you choose to share them or not, and an honest approach will help to build longterm trust.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>DONT'S</strong><br />\n<br />\n1. DON&rsquo;T KIBOSH IDEAS.<br />\nSet some parameters for your team to work within, but don&rsquo;t define each detail. If there&rsquo;s something that doesn&rsquo;t work from the onset, let your team run with it. Trust that they will find a solution.<br />\n<br />\n2. DON&rsquo;T CLOSE YOUR DOOR.<br />\nBe approachable and make time for people. Your time is worth its weight in gold. Closed doors should only be for private calls or confidential meetings.<br />\n<br />\n3. DON&rsquo;T ASK FOR FEEDBACK IF YOU DON&rsquo;T INTEND TO ACT ON IT.<br />\nIf you ask your team questions and collect data on how to improve your company&rsquo;s culture, then you need to act on it. If you don&rsquo;t, then don&rsquo;t bother&mdash;it will impact you more negatively in the long run.</p>"

Companies usually encourage women to be more ambitious, assertive, and to take more risks&mdash; in short, to behave more like what&rsquo;s expected from a traditional leader, i.e. a man. I think companies have to adapt to new leadership styles preferred by women rather than ask the women themselves to change.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nCompanies should place more value on empathy, collaboration, generosity, and sharing of power&mdash; traits that are typically associated with women and are not necessarily highly prized by companies at the C-suite level.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThat said, I think Cossette and its holding company, V7, have embraced this philosophy and have created an environment whereby women like myself are nurtured and can remain true to themselves. Which explains why I&rsquo;m still here after 18 years!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What has your personal experience been like moving into a leadership role?</strong><br />\nAs Global President and CEO, I&rsquo;ve been working with leaders in other business sectors who have problems and realities different from my own. I believe that it&rsquo;s important to see others&rsquo; points of view. To not be too quick to judge, and to put&nbsp;myself&nbsp;in their shoes. With empathy, curiosity&nbsp;and&nbsp;understanding, I have learned to make a greater effort to appreciate each person&rsquo;s reality and to not dismiss anything as futile or trivial.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nStaying true to myself, to my values and my leadership&nbsp;style,&nbsp;is a conscious choice I&rsquo;ve made. However, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s always been easy.&nbsp;<br />\nGenerally speaking, hiring practices&nbsp;favour&nbsp;a more conventional leadership style. New scorecards are needed to change the way people are hired, along with the types of skills that are valued, thereby increasing the level of female presence at the C-suite level.<br />\n<br />\nCompanies should also be more willing to adapt their operations to be more in line with the realities faced not only by women but by all employees.<br />\n<br />\nAbsolutely. Diversity is our greatest strength. It&rsquo;s at the root of everything&mdash;it&rsquo;s anthropological. It makes us stronger and more resistant. For me, the idea is to have men and women in leadership roles who come from a variety of cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. However, if once they assume their roles, they all do the same things in all the same ways, or develop the same&nbsp;behaviours, it defeats the purpose.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Do you consider greater diversity to be an asset?</strong><br />\nMore specifically to advertising, diversity brings different points of view to the same problem, so it reduces risk. It provides a variety of ideas, which means a higher chance of success. Better representation of different types of people in our workforce not only means a greater likelihood of attracting&nbsp;high-calibre&nbsp;talent,&nbsp;but also provides a better understanding of our target markets. Our creative and strategic product will reflect this diversity, and we&rsquo;ll be able to speak to more consumers. There are huge benefits all around.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What can businesses do to better accommodate all employees?</strong><br />\nMany companies have programs to support employees who have children, like onsite daycares, flexible hours and virtual work, but few people in the C-suite take advantage of these. I try to be a role model and lead by example. New employees are more likely to take advantage of these perks if their bosses do so as well.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nOften I&rsquo;m called upon to attend inter-office meetings or interact with people who aren&rsquo;t in the same city, but due to personal responsibilities, such as caring for my family, I&rsquo;m not always able to be there in person. Just because I can&rsquo;t physically attend a meeting doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not fully present. And it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m less dedicated or less involved. Being able to connect by phone or video conferencing for these meetings, without being negatively perceived, is worth its weight in gold. Thankfully, my company is very open to this practice and have put several technologies in place to make it easy to do.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nI enjoy taking advantage of flexible hours, and I won&rsquo;t hide or feel guilty. While it&rsquo;s important to show that I&rsquo;m committed and making an effort, it&rsquo;s equally important to be a well-balanced person.

Carefully choose the topics you talk about because they can speak volumes about the kind of culture you&rsquo;re trying to cultivate. If your desired culture is one that is familial and casual, you&rsquo;ll want to talk about your employees in a personal way and reference the things going on in their lives outside of work.

First, the conflict we had engaged in&mdash;as uncomfortable as it felt at the time&mdash;was a wonderful thing because it allowed us to get closer to the truth, which often lies somewhere between two divergent points of view (though this was not a new revelation for me, I am amazed at how much I still need reminders). Second, those divergent points of view were based, not on randomness, but on the diverse personality profiles of the people on either side; one side was comprised of our more rational and data-driven team members while the other represented our more emotional, intuition-dependent people.<br />\n<br />\nWhich brings me back to the power of diversity, and the reason why it remains so misunderstood and under-exploited in most organizations: it requires conflict.<br />\n<br />\nThe practical advantage of diversity boils down to this: a group of people with different perspectives usually makes better decisions and finds more creative solutions than those who have largely similar views, backgrounds and skill sets.

We often just nod our heads and move on. But it matters. So how can we put flesh and blood on the idea to make it more than just a nice saying? How can companies embody the connection between culture and the bottom line? Here are ten ways.</p>",
      "description": "<p><strong>1. End the Burnout Delusion</strong><br />\nBurnout is not the price we must pay for success. Leaders need to realize that taking care of their human capital is just as important as PnL, Ebitda and quarterly earnings. Living a sustainable life, and making sure their employees do too, is the best way for a leader to sustain growth.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Embrace Openness</strong><br />\nThe more transparent a company&rsquo;s culture, the more likely it is that the inevitable problems can be routinely identified and fixed before a crisis hits. Every time a mistake or failure comes to light, and lessons are drawn from whatever went wrong, a company is a step closer to a culture built for growth rather than just maintenance.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Avoid the \"Growth Above All\" Mindset</strong><br />\nThe idea of growth as a purpose and end in itself becomes cancerous. It metastasizes into every area of the company&mdash;determining the people who are promoted and, increasingly, the people who are hired. Left unchecked, it subsumes all other primary values&mdash; including empathy, collaboration, and professionalism.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Make the Workplace Work for Women</strong><br />\nFar too many workplaces are fueled by a culture of machismo&mdash;itself often&nbsp;driven by a &ldquo;growth above all&rdquo; mindset and burnout glorification. We talk a lot about gender parity and how there should be more women at the top of every profession, but we&rsquo;re never going to get there if we don&rsquo;t change the day to- day experience of women at every level. Here are some signs that your workplace is not working for women:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Women have to pump milk in the bathroom because you've made room for a ping-pong table but not for a private corner for new mothers.</li>\n <li>The only way you have to bond with teams is drunken parties.</li>\n <li>Leaders tell the company story and try to motivate people using all Art of War metaphors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />\n<strong>5. Getting Rid of Brilliant Jerks</strong><br />\nToo many companies buy into the cult of the top performer, which tolerates otherwise unacceptable behavior. The collateral damage may not become obvious immediately but is unmistakable over time, as it determines what behavior is deemed acceptable (at least for the select few). Narrowly defined performance is like short-term growth: it might appear to keep you going forward day by day, but a company will eventually find itself way off course. We need to expand our performance evaluations to include embodying cultural principles&mdash;like empathy and inclusivity.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Use Teams to Build Resilience</strong><br />\nIt is imperative, at a time of accelerated change, to create cultures that value building teams. Teams can be always on, but individuals can&rsquo;t. They can offer support, and amplify and reinforce incentives. They also build empathy, foster creativity and strengthen resilience. As you learned from your high school gym teacher, for a team the total is more than the sum of its parts.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. Treat Culture as the Company's Immune System</strong><br />\nInternally, a healthy company values and celebrates everyone&rsquo;s contributions&mdash;which directly impacts retention and recruitment. Externally, an unhealthy culture can quickly lead to multiple problems and crises that can damage a company&rsquo;s reputation, especially in the era of social media. In a culture that has run itself down, our resilience becomes compromised much like the resilience of the human body does; we become more susceptible to viruses that are part of every company (because they&rsquo;re part of human nature). In healthier times, we&rsquo;re collectively able to identify these toxic elements and quickly reject them.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. Meet the Demand For Purpose</strong><br />\nMillennials expect and demand that the brands they identify with stand&nbsp;for principles beyond profit. At the same time, technology has made it impossible for companies to hide behind a glossy ad campaign, and a half-hearted claim to authenticity will undermine a brand. After all, authenticity is the foundation of trust, which is easily shattered&mdash;and hard to rebuild. Building trust with consumers is much harder when employees themselves don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re part of a trusting and authentic culture.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9. Model Change at the Top</strong><br />\nOnly leaders mature enough &mdash; whatever their age!&mdash;to find a center of strength and calm in the middle of any challenge can initiate the changes a culture needs. And from that place they can make the best decisions for the company. When employees see their leaders modeling this behavior, it creates a ripple effect, especially if employees who follow suit are celebrated and promoted.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>10. Use Crisis as an Opportunity</strong><br />\nAny crisis that happens as a result of overlooked cultural problems is also an opportunity to turbo-charge cultural changes that are sometimes harder to implement without a catalyst. Often, because of inertia or stakeholders protecting the status quo, a spark is needed to get people to look beyond just what&rsquo;s next on their to-do list. I&rsquo;m a big believer in the power of catharsis (not just because I&rsquo;m Greek!)&mdash;a purging process that facilitates renewal. The goal when a crisis hits shouldn&rsquo;t be just to get through it but instead to come out with a stronger culture than ever before.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Mind The Gap</strong><br />\nIt has been nearly 30 years since corporate Canada acknowledged the gender gap in our workforce. While many organizations and leaders have and continue to take steps to make progress, we&mdash;as a business community and society&mdash;have not progressed fast enough.<br />\n<br />\nToday, only 3% of the world&rsquo;s top 500 companies are led by women, according to a recent Ipsos poll, and a 2017 Canadian Securities Administrators report found that only 14% of public company board seats in Canada were occupied by women. That&rsquo;s a marginal improvement from 11% in 2015. Specifically within the tech industry, our Move the Dial report revealed that 5% of Canadian tech companies had female founders or CEOs.<br />\n<br />\nThe culprit for this slow progress seems to be a deeper, systemic issue around inclusion. In PwC&rsquo;s global study Time to talk: What has to change for women at work, 71% of Canadian women were actively seeking opportunities to develop and advance in their careers.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, more than a third were concerned that their gender, age, ethnicity or sexual preference would be a barrier to their progression. Forty-one percent of new mothers felt overlooked for promotions and development opportunities upon returning to work. The message was clear and we must listen; opportunities are not equal for everyone.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Shifting From Diversity to Inclusion</strong><br />\nI believe it&rsquo;s time to shift the conversation from diversity to inclusion. Verna Myers once famously said: &ldquo;Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance&rdquo;. Building a culture of inclusion is critical to realize the benefits of our differences and become a more progressive business and society. That means fostering an environment where people can bring their best, most authentic selves to work so that innovative ideas can thrive.<br />\n<br />\nThe benefits of inclusion are well&nbsp;documented. PwC&rsquo;s 2018 Women in Work Index suggests that if we harness the full potential of the female workforce at all levels within organizations, we would see a US$6 trillion growth in OECD GDP. And research by Catalyst shows that Fortune 500 companies with the highest percentage of female directors on their boards report 53% higher returns on equity. From a broader customer perspective, 72% of Canadian CEOs in PwC&rsquo;s Global CEO Survey said having a diversity and inclusion lens helped them satisfy evolving customer needs and improve their bottom line.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Accelerating Progress</strong><br />\n<br />\nThere are four actions we can take as leaders to foster a more inclusive culture.<br />\n<br />\n<em>1. Be Purpose-led, Values-Driven</em><br />\nEvery conversation around diversity and inclusion should be connected to your broader organizational purpose, values and business strategy. At PwC,&nbsp;inclusiveness lies at the heart of our broader business, customer and people strategies. Rather than treating diversity and inclusion as a one-time PR or HR exercise, we focus on how it will enable us to build stronger teams, be more innovative, and deliver on our purpose of helping solve important problems and build trust in society. Talking about diversity and inclusion in this way helps our leaders and people understand that actions to support this priority are rooted in our values, and should be at the core of every interaction with our people, clients and stakeholders.<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. Secure Leadership Buy-In and Actions</em><br />\nDeveloping a high performing, inclusive culture requires commitment from the top. That means getting leaders to role model inclusive behaviours and actively sponsor top talent. Being a sponsor means being more than a sounding board for career advice. It requires playing an active role in helping women develop critical skills and relationships, and putting your credibility on the line as their champion when development opportunities arise.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I became CEO of PwC Canada seven years ago, changing the demographic of my Canadian Leadership Team was one of my top priorities. How could I ask my partners to consider more diversity on their leadership and account teams when my own team was&nbsp;not reflective of the diversity in our firm? Through some immediate actions and sponsorship of talent, we now have two highly accomplished women on our fivemember executive team who lead two of the firm&rsquo;s largest business units. And each member of our Canadian and Extended Leadership Teams are responsible for identifying and sponsoring top female talent at the senior manager, director and partner levels. We role model the behaviours of inclusiveness, mentorship and sponsorship for others.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. Accountability to Drive Actions.</em><br />\nProgress doesn&rsquo;t happen on good intentions alone; goals foster accountability and drive actions. This is not about creating quotas for the sake of checking a box. It&rsquo;s about setting aspirational goals to measure progress and drive actions to create a more inclusive and level playing field for everyone. At PwC, we set a national business goal of achieving 50/50 gender parity among our new partner admits by 2020. We evaluate how each business unit&mdash;and its partners and coaches&mdash;are contributing to this goal and the results inform our approach to recruitment, learning and development, and succession planning efforts. We&rsquo;re also a proud signatory of the 2022 Catalyst Accord, which holds Canadian businesses publicly accountable for the advancement of women in corporate&nbsp;Canada. That accountability is helping us deliver on our commitment. Today, 30% of our Canadian PwC Board members are female and last year, 55% of our new Tax partners and 42% of new Assurance partners were female! Yes, we have more to do but setting and publicly stating our aspirational goals has moved the dial for us.<br />\n<br />\n<em>4. Understand our biases and adjust Behaviours</em><br />\nWe all have biases. It&rsquo;s important that we learn what they are so that we understand how they affect our decisions and adjust our actions. There&rsquo;s a common stereotype that those who prioritize work-life balance or seek flexible working arrangements are lazy, or lack the capabilities or commitment to be a high performer. Leaders and coaches must recognize that everyone contributes in different ways, and work-life balance and flexibility needs are important to everyone, not just to those of a certain life stage or gender. Setting aside our biases and encouraging people to take advantage of these types of support programs will only help them become stronger and more engaged&mdash;at home and at work&mdash;and will improve the satisfaction and retention of top talent. A free Gender Bias eLearn&mdash;co-created by PwC and United Nations Women&mdash;is available online at heforshe.pwc.com to help you and your teams learn more about unconscious biases.</p>",

It requires playing an active role in helping women develop critical skills and relationships, and putting your credibility on the line as their champion when development opportunities arise.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I became CEO of PwC Canada seven years ago, changing the demographic of my Canadian Leadership Team was one of my top priorities. How could I ask my partners to consider more diversity on their leadership and account teams when my own team was&nbsp;not reflective of the diversity in our firm? Through some immediate actions and sponsorship of talent, we now have two highly accomplished women on our fivemember executive team who lead two of the firm&rsquo;s largest business units. And each member of our Canadian and Extended Leadership Teams are responsible for identifying and sponsoring top female talent at the senior manager, director and partner levels. We role model the behaviours of inclusiveness, mentorship and sponsorship for others.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. Accountability to Drive Actions.</em><br />\nProgress doesn&rsquo;t happen on good intentions alone; goals foster accountability and drive actions. This is not about creating quotas for the sake of checking a box. It&rsquo;s about setting aspirational goals to measure progress and drive actions to create a more inclusive and level playing field for everyone. At PwC, we set a national business goal of achieving 50/50 gender parity among our new partner admits by 2020. We evaluate how each business unit&mdash;and its partners and coaches&mdash;are contributing to this goal and the results inform our approach to recruitment, learning and development, and succession planning efforts. We&rsquo;re also a proud signatory of the 2022 Catalyst Accord, which holds Canadian businesses publicly accountable for the advancement of women in corporate&nbsp;Canada. That accountability is helping us deliver on our commitment. Today, 30% of our Canadian PwC Board members are female and last year, 55% of our new Tax partners and 42% of new Assurance partners were female! Yes, we have more to do but setting and publicly stating our aspirational goals has moved the dial for us.<br />\n<br />\n<em>4. Understand our biases and adjust Behaviours</em><br />\nWe all have biases. It&rsquo;s important that we learn what they are so that we understand how they affect our decisions and adjust our actions. There&rsquo;s a common stereotype that those who prioritize work-life balance or seek flexible working arrangements are lazy, or lack the capabilities or commitment to be a high performer. Leaders and coaches must recognize that everyone contributes in different ways, and work-life balance and flexibility needs are important to everyone, not just to those of a certain life stage or gender. Setting aside our biases and encouraging people to take advantage of these types of support programs will only help them become stronger and more engaged&mdash;at home and at work&mdash;and will improve the satisfaction and retention of top talent. A free Gender Bias eLearn&mdash;co-created by PwC and United Nations Women&mdash;is available online at heforshe.pwc.com to help you and your teams learn more about unconscious biases.</p>"

      "description": "<p><strong>There is something that all great leaders do.</strong><br />\n<br />\nThere is something that all great leaders do that we can all learn from. Many of the best leaders (in business, community, politics and entertainment) study leadership traits like presentation skills, body language, persuasion with a depth and rigor that few of us do. There are countless bestselling business books and TED Talks that tackle these subjects. Professionals will spend thousands of dollars each year to attend conferences, where these specific topics are covered. From overall&nbsp;strategies to very specific tactics, those who know how to present an idea - in a powerful way - tend to get ahead. Personally, I&rsquo;ve had the great pleasure of being able to grow my business from a small startup in 2000 to being acquired by WPP (the world&rsquo;s largest marketing and communications network in the world) to turning that business into a now-global brand called Mirum. With over 2000 employees in over 20 countries and under the WPP banner, I still get to travel the world and&nbsp;present on stages like The Art Of&hellip; to businesses (small, medium, large, b2b and b2c). In short: I get to watch some of the world&rsquo;s best brands and leaders present their ideas. I also get to sit in the audience and take notes. I get to see which ideas take flight... and which ideas flop. Which leaders can convey a semi-decent idea that gets mass buy-in, versus a leader who&nbsp;can&rsquo;t get their team around a very powerful and transformative concept. Yes, it&rsquo;s about communications and presence. Still, there are four key components that make ideas connect, and we have seen this in everything from a new business pitch to an investor, to a global brand looking to shift business models, to a politician attempting to take office and beyond.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Here are the four ways to lead with authenticity in uncertain times:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<em>1. I See You</em><br />\nYour audience has to know that you are not talking at them. Your audience has to know that you are not talking to them. Your audience must feel like you are talking with them. Every audience member has to not only feel - but know - that you see them. You know them. You understand their day-to-day, and that you&rsquo;re not there to float your own ideas, but rather create a solution to what they (truly) face - day in and day out. Without judgement. &ldquo;I see you.&rdquo; When someone is in trouble (emotional, physical or spiritual), they want you to see them... not feel bad for them. This is my number one motivation before clipping a microphone on my shirt. I want my audience to know this: I see you.<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. I Understand You</em><br />\nThis does not mean that you have to listen to their feedback or ask for input. This does mean that you understand their challenges, because you have seen them, experienced them and are not just compassionate about those challenges, but that you have thought long and hard about what it means to be them. A lot of leaders think that they understand the situation, when - in reality - they have a thought about how to solve the challenge - at a leadership level - without understanding how it truly affects each and every person on the team and in the work that they do.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. This Is Now Yours/Ours</em><br />\nThink about the businesses that offer employees ownership opportunities. Think about the businesses that constantly attempt to cut out the layers of management and rules/regulations to allow people to flourish. These are bold and powerful first-steps. Now, think about the leaders that remove themselves from the pedestal and truly empower everyone to take part in the success (and, let&rsquo;s be clear: financial success is only part of this equation). Think about the leaders who truly build a team... a movement. Great leaders don&rsquo;t build great companies or great teams. Great leaders turn everything into a movement that everyone takes ownership and responsibility for. Great leaders make it everyone&rsquo;s for the taking.<br />\n<br />\n<em>4. You Are Not Forgotten...and&nbsp; Never Will Be Again.</em><br />\nWe are all worried about the effort that we put into our own lives. Are we doing enough? How are we performing? We are all worried how we are perceived by our peers and by our leaders. All of us have our own set of insecurities. All of us have moments where we feel like we&rsquo;re not a part of something meaningful or bigger than us. Along with &ldquo;I See You,&rdquo; many people do feel forgotten (either a lot of the time or at some moment in time). From not getting that promotion, to being let go and beyond. The best leaders remind their audience that they are not forgotten, and that they won&rsquo;t be forgotten moving forward. It&rsquo;s powerful. It doesn&rsquo;t always come to fruition, but if you can make your audience acknowledge the moments when they have felt forgotten, and honestly reassure them that this is going to end, you can - and will - win them over. It can&rsquo;t be a platitude. It has to be something that they live and breathe.<br />\n<br />\nThese are ambiguous tools, so do no evil.<br />\n<br />\nAll tools of presentation, persuasion, influence, leadership and beyond can be (and have been) used for evil. These same tools have been used to make partisan groups more divided than united. The tools are ambiguous. Before presenting ideas (on stage, in a board room, over a meal), the 4 concepts above are meant for the leader to equalize his thinking in terms of the relationship between presenter and audience. Great leadership moving forward feels inclusive. Brand, innovation, transformation, dealing with disruption, building better experiences... this is what we do. This is what great leaders must do.</p>",

      "description": "<p>For those of us in the technology world we know that growth often follows disruption, and that disruption leads to a need for transformation.<br />\n<br />\nFor most of my professional life, I have been focused on transforming organizations within the technology industry. Early in my career, I discovered a passion for business transformation after joining a Canadian organization to help turn around a unionized sales division. After that, my interest was piqued and I began actively seeking out these types of opportunities. Over time, I learned what to look for in an organization that was in the right position to undergo a transformation, and how I could help affect that change effectively.<br />\n<br />\nBut now, there&rsquo;s another type of transformation that needs to take place, specifically in the way women are treated within the Canadian STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) industries.<br />\n<br />\nI believe my experience at Cogeco Peer 1, and how we have been focused on turning around a high potential, but nevertheless, the underperforming division could provide a bit of a blueprint for a transformation of the broader industry. It&rsquo;s a strategy that involves a lot of listening, consensus, and making quick decisions that create impactful results.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I joined Cogeco Peer 1 in May 2017, I immediately put into place what I like to call my 90-day game plan. The first 30 days were about listening, assessing, and going deep into the business. Over the next 30 days - I expanded my listening tour outside my&nbsp;hard reports, I broadened my reach, and started floating ideas. The last 30 days, it was time to get started, and to act. Quick wins were important. Strategy was set, and we started to execute.<br />\n<br />\nNow, eight months later, Cogeco Peer 1 is strongly positioned for growth. With a strong, seasoned management team in place we are now ready to take on the industry. And not unlike what I have had to do in my own career, we are ready to compete and aggressively differentiate ourselves from the rest of our industry.<br />\n<br />\nOne of those areas where Cogeco Peer 1 differentiates itself happens to be the number of women working in the highest ranks of the company. In fact, Cogeco Peer 1&rsquo;s three General Managers are all women. I firmly believe that our turnaround has been due, at least in part, to the diversity of voices we have in the upper echelons of the company.<br />\n<br />\nAnd while that&rsquo;s an impressive start, our industry needs a structural change of its own to make sure that simply having women in leadership roles does not set us apart from the rest of the industry. According to the 2016 Canadian Labour Force Survey, women make up just 27% of the workforce in information and communications technology (ICT) firms. What&rsquo;s worse is that number is down from 2011, when we made up 30% of the workforce in ICT companies.<br />\n<br />\nThat&rsquo;s where our community of female leaders can impact change. When you consider how few women there are in the technology world today, and how our numbers are declining, and how important those voices are to the future of the industry and the way we create products and services, it&rsquo;s easy to see why it&rsquo;s so critical for all of us to do everything we can to get more women into the technology field.<br />\n<br />\nFrom a broader, macroeconomic perspective, when you realize that most of the good new jobs in our modern economy are being created in the STEM fields, you can quickly see why it&rsquo;s so critical for us all to come together to inspire our young girls to pursue careers in these fields.<br />\n<br />\nFor all of us women in the technology field, we can be powerful allies for younger women as soon as they enter their first roles in an industry that is heavily dominated by men.<br />\n<br />\nBefore I found the first strong female mentor who helped me navigate&nbsp;corporate Canada and bring out my authentic self, (my unicorn, as I call her), I had a rocky start. I didn&rsquo;t always get the best advice. One of my first mentors coached me to hide my femininity.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so much with your hands, and watch the inflection in your voice, or people won&rsquo;t take you seriously,&rdquo; they told me. That advice got to me&mdash;and not in a positive way.<br />\n<br />\nAt the outset of my career, I was nervous. I dyed my blonde hair brown and kept it tied up or back, dressed in overly conservative business suits,&nbsp;and wore glasses. I did anything and everything I could do to tone down my femininity. I was hiding who I really was. Thankfully, I figured out that the real path to success lay in my ability to embrace my femininity and through it my authentic self, but I wouldn&rsquo;t learn that without some help.<br />\n<br />\nPersonally, it took seven years before I found the woman in my organization who helped turn things around for me.<br />\n<br />\nToday, just five per cent of Canadian technology companies have a female CEO, and more than half don&rsquo;t have a single female executive. And according to the Conference Board of Canada, women&rsquo;s progress in reaching senior management positions has stalled, with men being two to three times more likely to be in a senior management position than women.<br />\n<br />\nFemale leaders can transform businesses. Through coaching and mentorship, we can transform industries and ensure young woman see themselves in senior management roles.<br />\n<br />\nWe need a transformation that enables more young girls to believe they can excel in science, technology, engineering and math. One that enables young women to believe a degree in STEM is the way of the future.<br />\n<br />\nChange doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. And the place of women in the technology world is no exception. I&rsquo;m proud to work for a forward- thinking organization like Cogeco Peer 1 that believes in the power of female executives and is investing in the future of the company and powering the potential of the industry.<br />\n<br />\nBut we all need to do our part if we&rsquo;re going to come together and affect real change. We&rsquo;ve listened, we&rsquo;ve assessed, we&rsquo;ve broadened our reach, and it is time to get started, and to take action leading a transformation that will change the look and feel of the types of people in our industry.<br />\n<br />\nAnd it starts with supporting one another.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p>In 2017, the World Economic Forum predicted we&rsquo;d be closing the economic gender gap in 217 years&mdash;37 years longer than the estimate they provided in the year prior. It wasn&rsquo;t, unfortunately, that surprising; in many key measures, from workforce participation to the gender wage gap, we haven&rsquo;t moved the needle significantly for twenty years.<br />\n<br />\nWhich leads to the question: Why is our progress in gender parity so slow?<br />\n<br />\nAs the Co-CEO of Women of Influence, an organization that has&nbsp;been working for women&rsquo;s workplace equality for 24 years, this is a problem I consider daily. The simplest answer is that the issue is complex, rooted in our culture and fueled by unconscious bias. A massive societal mindshift doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. True, but accelerated and meaningful change at an organizational level&mdash;from eradicating their gender wage gap to setting a 50:50 target for leadership&mdash;are efforts that, when added up, make a significant difference in the overall picture.<br />\n<br />\nIn January we partnered with Catalyst Canada on the first annual Radical Change Summit, which brought together business leaders who had taken a leap forward in gender equality, rather than a small step. They shared not only their successes, but also how they achieved them&mdash;with the goal of inspiring others to take similar action. As our keynote speaker, Sarah Kaplan, director of the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto&rsquo;s Rotman School of Management, put it: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need three silver bullets, we need a thousand flowers blooming.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Be Aware of How Bias is Embedded in Your Current Systems</strong><br />\n&ldquo;If I had one piece of advice it would be this: Pay attention to the ways that current systems, policies and practices unintentionally create tailwinds for some people (white, straight men) and headwinds for others (underrepresented groups). Don&rsquo;t focus so much on the implicit bias in our brains, which is hard to change. Rather, look at how bias is embedded in practices and come up with innovative solutions to change those practices.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2.

Give Women Equal Access to \"Hot Jobs\"</strong><br />\n&ldquo;Make sure that women get equal access to &lsquo;hot jobs&rsquo; and other on-the-job development opportunities. Catalyst research shows that women are less likely than men to lead large and highly visible projects, have access to P&amp;L roles, or receive international assignments that accelerate advancement. This inequity stifles women&rsquo;s progress, and can drive them to seek out opportunities elsewhere. Ensure talent management practices include metrics that track who receives access to critical on-the-job development opportunities, and require at least two qualified women to be considered for each open opportunity.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Intentionally Recruit Outside your Own Networks and Comfort Zone</strong><br />\n&ldquo;Hire and promote from 100%, rather than 50%, of the talent pool. Equity nurtures excellence.

Embrace difference for the innovative potential it offers.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Adopt a Zero Tolerance Policy for Discrimination and Harassment</strong><br />\n&ldquo;Organizations need to have a zero tolerance environment in the workplace for discrimination and sexual harassment. Simply put, an organization that does not promote the safety of its employees, leaves itself open to losing its talent and damaging its reputation.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. Comply with Pay Equity Laws in Spirit and in Fact. Don't wait for Complaint to be filed or an Audit to take Place.</strong><br />\n&ldquo;A commitment to equal pay for equal work and pay equity will signal to female employees that you are serious about gender economic equality, leading to better employee engagement and retention of female employees, and benefitting from the diversity of thought that women bring to the workplace.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. Take Time to Recognize your Organization's High-Potential Women</strong><br />\n&ldquo;Ensure leaders are taking the time to recognize high-potential women.

So it&rsquo;s essential that senior leaders are aware and understand the power/ impact that mentoring and sponsorship can have on their culture.

          "textOnly": "<p>In 2017, the World Economic Forum predicted we&rsquo;d be closing the economic gender gap in 217 years&mdash;37 years longer than the estimate they provided in the year prior. It wasn&rsquo;t, unfortunately, that surprising; in many key measures, from workforce participation to the gender wage gap, we haven&rsquo;t moved the needle significantly for twenty years.<br />\n<br />\nWhich leads to the question: Why is our progress in gender parity so slow?<br />\n<br />\nAs the Co-CEO of Women of Influence, an organization that has&nbsp;been working for women&rsquo;s workplace equality for 24 years, this is a problem I consider daily. The simplest answer is that the issue is complex, rooted in our culture and fueled by unconscious bias. A massive societal mindshift doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. True, but accelerated and meaningful change at an organizational level&mdash;from eradicating their gender wage gap to setting a 50:50 target for leadership&mdash;are efforts that, when added up, make a significant difference in the overall picture.<br />\n<br />\nIn January we partnered with Catalyst Canada on the first annual Radical Change Summit, which brought together business leaders who had taken a leap forward in gender equality, rather than a small step. They shared not only their successes, but also how they achieved them&mdash;with the goal of inspiring others to take similar action.

      "description": "<p>Just the announcement that Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Jaime Dimon will be entering the health care space has sent shock waves for industry incumbents such as CVS, Cigna, and UnitedHealth. It also puts a fundamental question back on the agendas of CEOs in other industries: Will software eat the world, as Marc Andreessen famously quipped? Is this a warning shot that signals that other legacy industrial companies, such as Ford, Deere, and Rolls Royce are also at increased risk of being disrupted?<br />\n<br />\nTo start to answer that question, let&rsquo;s tally up the score. There are three types of products today. Digital natives&nbsp;(Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM) have gained competitive advantage in the first two, and the jury is still out on the third:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Type 1</strong><br />\nThese are &ldquo;pure&rdquo; information goods, where digital natives rule. An example would be Google in search, or Facebook in social networking. Their business models benefit from internet connectivity and they enjoy tremendous network effects.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Type 2</strong><br />\nThese are once-analog products that have now been converted into digital products, such as photography, books, and music. Here too, digital natives dominate. These products are typically sold as a service via digital distribution platforms (Audible.com for books, Spotify for music, Netflix for movies).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Type 3</strong><br />\nThen there are products where inputoutput efficiency and reliability of the physical components are still critical but digital is becoming an integral part of the product itself (in effect, computers are being put inside products). This is the world of the Internet of Things (IOT) and the Industrial Internet.<br />\n<br />\nManufacturing-heavy companies such as Caterpillar, Ford, and Rolls Royce compete in this world. An aircraft engine is unlikely to become a purely digital product any time soon! Such products have three components: physical components, &ldquo;smart&rdquo; components (sensors, controls, microprocessors, software, and enhanced user interface), and connectivity (one machine connected to another machine; one machine connected to many machines; and many machines connected to each other in a system).<br />\n<br />\nDigital natives have already disrupted industries such as media, publishing, travel, music, and photography. But who is likely to assume leadership in creating and capturing economic value in Type 3 products: Digital natives or industry incumbents? Ford or Tesla? Rolls Royce or IBM? Caterpillar or Microsoft? Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase combine or UnitedHealth?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Challenges for Digital Natives</strong><br />\nValue will no doubt be created in the era of smart, connected machines. We don&rsquo;t expect Amazon or Microsoft or IBM to design, make, and market agricultural tractors, aircraft engines, or MR scanners. The question really is: Can digital natives develop softwareenabled solutions that siphon off significant value from industrial hardware? The answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; But it won&rsquo;t be easy. It will require tremendous amounts of investments in building new capabilities for hardware companies like HP, Cisco, Dell, Samsung, and Lenovo; established software companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft; and start-ups. In particular, there are three barriers they must overcome:<br />\n<br />\n<em>1. The Physics of hardware</em><br />\nCompanies like Rolls Royce design and manufacture jet engines. These are very complicated machines. There is hard science behind these machines. That&rsquo;s much different than digital natives like Airbnb where marketing is more important than technical expertise.<br />\n<br />\nIndustry incumbents have expertise in the material sciences, for instance. Further, scientific knowledge keeps improving over time. They have made heavy R&amp;D investments&mdash;both basic and applied&mdash;to remain at the cuttingedge of the physics of the hardware. Much of this scientific knowledge is protected by patents.<br />\n<br />\nMastery of hard science is a pre-requisite to develop softwarebased solutions on the hardware. These companies&rsquo; superior product/ domain knowledge provides them the comparative advantage to model the asset&rsquo;s performance and write high-end/high value-added software&nbsp;applications. A &ldquo;pure&rdquo; digital company can write commodity software applications. But it must acquire enough capabilities on the physics to write sophisticated apps that improve assets&rsquo; performance.<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. Customer intimacy</em><br />\nIndustrial giants have well-established brands, built strong customer relationships, and signed longterm service contracts. They&rsquo;ve won the customer &rsquo;s trust, which is why customers are willing to share data. Digital natives can work with industrial customers, but they have to first earn their trust; they must build capabilities to understand customer operations; they must match the industrials&rsquo; cumulative learning from customer interactions; they must learn to ask for the right data; and they have to hire experts in several verticals that can turn data into insights.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. Difficulty in sharing risks</em><br />\nIndustrial incumbents have product knowledge, customer relationships, and field engineers on customer sites. Companies like Rolls Royce can, therefore, offer outcome deals where they guarantee customer outcomes (examples: zero downtime, higher speed, more fuel efficiency, zero operator error, greater reliability) and share risks and rewards with customers. It would be very hard for Amazon or Google to guarantee customer outcomes and take risks with businesses whose operations they know little about.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Challenges for Industrial Giants</strong><br />\nCan the industrial giants lead in the Industrial Internet? The answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; But it won&rsquo;t be easy for them, either. They too have three significant barriers to overcome:</p>\n<p><em>1. Software Talent</em><br />\nThe IT talent in industrial companies can execute projects oriented towards process efficiency and cost reduction. That talent is ill-suited to develop new, breakthrough software products that offer superior customer outcomes. For that end, they must be able to attract world-class innovators and software engineers. Is, say, Rolls Royce, in the same consideration set as Facebook and Google for young tech employees? Not, really. If so, how can the industrial giants compete to attract the best talent?<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. Digital Culture</em><br />\nIndustrial businesses and digital businesses operate with completely different principles. The characteristics of hardware businesses include long product development cycle, Six Sigma efficiency, and long sales cycle. Software businesses have different characteristics: short product development cycle, flexibility, and short sales cycle. The industrials must build a digital culture based on concepts like lean, agile, simplicity, responsiveness, and speed. That&rsquo;s a tall order for an established enterprise.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. The Incumbent's Dilemma</em><br />\nDigital has the potential to disrupt industrial businesses. There are three ways digital strategy can cannibalize &ldquo;core&rdquo; industrial business. First, data and insights can help improve the productivity of machines; digital, therefore, has the potential to cannibalize future hardware sales. Second, data and insights increase the reliability of machines; digital therefore has the potential to cannibalize future service revenues. Third, software subscription and license might enable customers to do self-service. Current customers could terminate/renegotiate service contracts, and potential customers may not enter into service contracts at all. In short, it is very&nbsp;difficult for a company to disrupt itself. The future of the Industrial Internet will involve partnerships across a variety of players including tech companies and industrial companies. The key issue: Who will assume the leadership position to extract maximum economic value in such an ecosystem? Will industrial companies take the lead? Or will the digital natives take the lead? Both have a chance.<br />\n<br />\nIf I were a betting man, I would place my bets on tech giants over industry incumbents. One factor that will favor digital companies in the industrial internet is technological/scientific breakthroughs that level the playing field for newcomers. For example, breakthroughs in battery technology made the electric cars possible. Electric cars are much simpler to design than cars with internal combustion engines, allowing Tesla and BYD to enter the market despite Ford&rsquo;s decades of expertise. Since electrification and driverless cars go together, other tech companies such as Google, Baidu, Apple, and Lyft will also be able to enter the automotive market. Similar technological changes in jet engines and agricultural tractors can allow tech giants gain foothold in these industries as well.<br />\n<br />\nMore importantly, Amazon or Google have the resources to acquire the capabilities to master the physics and acquire customer relationships and compete with the industrial giants in the Industrial Internet. They have enough resources and some to buy them, if needed.<br />\n<br />\nAmong the tech giants, Amazon is a likely winner in the Industrial Internet. It has successfully fused physical with digital. Amazon understands the economic laws of analog products and is not afraid of massive up-front investments and slower growth. Its acquisition of Whole Foods and experiments with Amazon Go grocery stores are an example. Amazon is the one company everyone&rsquo;s scared of, even industrial giants.<br />\n<br />\n<em>This article originally appeared in HBR.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Life really is too short to be unhappy at work</strong><br />\nYet far too many of us aren&rsquo;t even close to being content&mdash;much less delighted&mdash;with our work or our workplaces. Instead, we are stressed and exhausted. We can&rsquo;t remember what we used to love about our jobs. Colleagues we trust and respect are few and far between, and half the time it doesn&rsquo;t even feel safe to be ourselves. All of this is spilling over into our personal lives. We&rsquo;re having a hard time sleeping or have given up on exercise. Relationships are suffering, too. We feel trapped and struggle to see how things will get better. To be happy, I&rsquo;ve discovered, you&rsquo;ve got to run toward something: a hopeful, inspiring vision of your future.<br />\n<br />\nNo one wants to live like this. Still, a lot of us give up and settle for lessthan- fulfilling jobs. We tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re not supposed to be happy at work; that&rsquo;s for other parts of life. We try to cope by avoiding that bad manager or getting that stubborn,&nbsp;annoying person off the team. We shut down, give less, and fantasize about telling someone off. Sometimes we run away from the job, the company, even our careers. But running away isn&rsquo;t going to make things better. To be happy, I&rsquo;ve discovered, you&rsquo;ve got to run toward something: a hopeful, inspiring vision of your future.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Hope is at the Heart of Happiness at Work</strong><br />\nHope is the starting point for creating a future that is better than today. It encourages us to dig deep down inside ourselves to find our most unique talents and gifts and to use all of our resources to help us along the way. Whatever difficulties we face&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s a health issue or a loss or a setback at work&mdash;the hope that tomorrow will be better is what helps us get up every morning, put one foot in front of the other, and carry on.<br />\n<br />\nAnd, when we believe that things will get better, they often do. That&rsquo;s because a hopeful, captivating, and personally compelling vision makes&nbsp;us feel strong, powerful, and in control. We are motivated to face up to our present challenges and even our fears and to take steps toward the future we want for ourselves and others.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How Hope Works</strong><br />\nThink about a project at work that you are passionately committed to&mdash; one that means a lot to you. Now imagine that you&rsquo;ve recently decided to slow the project down&mdash;to get it right rather than just get it done. Your boss doesn&rsquo;t agree. He just wants it finished and isn&rsquo;t concerned about cutting corners. If you are like most people, you&rsquo;ll immediately feel defensive. Something you care about is under attack. When we experience hope. The stress response diminishes: our breathing slows, muscles relax, and blood pressure drops. Our immune system even functions better.<br />\n<br />\nAs you conjure up all the bad things that could happen, you get scared. You&rsquo;re mad, too, and you start to second-guess your decision. At this&nbsp;point, you are not thinking clearly, you can&rsquo;t easily access reason and rationality, and you probably won&rsquo;t make very good decisions about what to do. You&rsquo;re in the throes of an amygdala hijack&mdash; that state when the limbic brain (what some people call the reptilian brain) is in charge and your higher-order thought processes shut down.<br />\n<br />\nFortunately, the exact opposite happens when we experience hope. The stress response diminishes: our breathing slows, muscles relax, and blood pressure drops. Our immune system even functions better. This physiological response helps us&nbsp;manage our emotions, especially emotions like anger and frustration that push us into amygdala hijack. We put unreasonable fears to rest, begin to see humor in situations, and tap into enthusiasm and energy.<br />\n<br />\nHope is a powerful human experience. It helps us in every aspect of our lives, including what we do and accomplish at work&mdash;and how happy we are at work. When we are hopeful, we can see ourselves as more potent in the world and more able to have an impact on our future.<br />\n<br />\nWith hope, along with a sense of purpose and meaningful friendships,&nbsp;we can find true happiness in our work. Luckily, we live in a time where organizations and academia are taking happiness seriously; leaders in major oil companies, provincial governments, technology startups and corporations often report that happy employees are more creative and committed. The personal and practical&mdash;not to mention economic&mdash;consequences of workplace unhappiness are too great to be ignored. By activating our emotional intelligence, and taking control of our own happiness, we can unleash our true potential&mdash;as employees and human beings.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

Instead, we are stressed and exhausted. We can&rsquo;t remember what we used to love about our jobs. Colleagues we trust and respect are few and far between, and half the time it doesn&rsquo;t even feel safe to be ourselves. All of this is spilling over into our personal lives. We&rsquo;re having a hard time sleeping or have given up on exercise. Relationships are suffering, too. We feel trapped and struggle to see how things will get better. To be happy, I&rsquo;ve discovered, you&rsquo;ve got to run toward something: a hopeful, inspiring vision of your future.<br />\n<br />\nNo one wants to live like this. Still, a lot of us give up and settle for lessthan- fulfilling jobs. We tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re not supposed to be happy at work; that&rsquo;s for other parts of life. We try to cope by avoiding that bad manager or getting that stubborn,&nbsp;annoying person off the team. We shut down, give less, and fantasize about telling someone off.

      "description": "<p>You might be feeling shocked or skeptical. You might be deeply disturbed by the decades of edicts that have diminished Middle Eastern women. By the harsh rules of gender segregation, the dearth of women&rsquo;s legal rights and the myriad of other well-documented sociocultural issues woven into the culture.<br />\n<br />\nI'm not asking you to set those realities aside.<br />\n<br />\nTo the contrary. My point is this: If a chief executive of a major corporation in the Middle East can influence women&rsquo;s equality amid this history, we all can. No excuses.<br />\n<br />\nAfter all, the Harvey Weinstein inspired reckoning in the U.S. has unmasked the fact that we&rsquo;re not nearly as far along toward our goal of gender equality as we thought. It&rsquo;s become painfully clear that organizations and industries around the world could use a more modern and pragmatic approach to gender dynamics.<br />\n<br />\nSo let&rsquo;s look at how this CEO is forging a new way ahead for women at a record pace&mdash;and how your organization can, too.<br />\n<br />\nBader Al-Kharafi was recently named the most influential man in Kuwait. Just 40 years old, he&rsquo;s innovative, thoughtful, and courageous. He has an engineering degree and an MBA from the London Business School, and he hails from a legendary business dynasty in Kuwait called M.A. Kharafi &amp; Sons (MAK), which operates 135 companies in 28 countries. And while it&rsquo;s never easy to follow in the footsteps of a renowned father, he&rsquo;s earned deep respect in the region for his leadership following his father&rsquo;s death in 2011.<br />\n<br />\nJust as important, Al-Kharafi comes from a family of strong women. His mother helped develop influential leaders in the family business (once named in Fortune as the 29th richest family in the world), his aunt was the president of Kuwait University, and his wife runs both a yoga studio and marathons. Al-Kharafi and his wife are raising their children to be good to others, honest, and always deliver on promises&mdash;the same principles that his parents taught him about business.<br />\n<br />\nWith those three principles to guide&nbsp;him, Al-Kharafi is now on a mission to re-engineer social dynamics in the workforce in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.<br />\n<br />\nMind you, it&rsquo;s a financially pragmatic approach, as well. After years of government funding from oil boom profits, residents across the region have disregarded productivity. The unemployment rate for the region&rsquo;s youth hovers around 30% (Why work when the government gives you money?), and 76% of women in the MENA region are not represented in the workplace, says the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Having as many women as men in the region&rsquo;s labor force could boost global GDP by $12 trillion.<br />\n<br />\nWhich means that unleashing the region&rsquo;s considerable human promise&mdash; its aspiring women&mdash;is a social and business imperative. Al-Kharafi has taken action by forming The Women&rsquo;s Empowerment Network, an initiative to transform the social and economic power of women in the MENA region.<br />\n<br />\nHe recently launched the initiative at his largest company, the Zain Group, where he&rsquo;s the vice chairman and group CEO. Zain is a leading mobile telecom provider serving 45 million customers in eight countries in the MENA region, from Saudi Arabia to South Sudan.<br />\n<br />\nI&rsquo;ve spent many years advising C-suite leaders at Fortune 500 companies on how to influence in all directions, regardless of the conditions. So I was honored when Al-Kharafi and his team asked me to help develop and lead the recent daylong kickoff of the initiative in Kuwait. The program included a live interview with Al-Kharafi, along with think tanks on women&rsquo;s empowerment, education, and entrepreneurship, with 250 female participants from Zain&rsquo;s eight countries along with 1,000 others via Livestream.<br />\n<br />\nOur goal was to create lists of actionable ideas to help women advance to leadership positions.<br />\n<br />\nAl-Kharafi and I expected that the women would rise up and share their truth and ideas. Others did not. I was warned that the women, while polite, would remain silent.<br />\n<br />\nThe opposite occurred. The women stepped up and responded by sharing their truths, openly, all day. They created an impressive list of attainable ideas to help men and women lead together in their region.<br />\n<br />\nI was stunned at the rapid pace of meaningful change. Al-Kharafi and his team began to implement the ideas within days, creating new policies and processes to help women fast-track their growth, including leadership coaching, mentoring programs, and even fully paid MBA educations.<br />\n<br />\nIf other organizations around the globe embrace this pragmatic approach, it will elevate gender dynamics everywhere. In other words, a leader in the Middle East can help all of us push the reset button on our own attempts to attract, retain, and develop leaders of both sexes.<br />\n<br />\nThis assignment taught me new lessons. Here are five things that the most influential leaders like Al-Kharafi are doing to ensure positive change in gender dynamics:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. The CEO Must Boldly Champion the Movement.</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s imperative that the CEO gets out front and leads this empowerment change&mdash;and is not just a figurehead. The chief executive must make gender parity a priority and clearly define the movement&rsquo;s intentions, ideal outcomes, measurements, and expectations. These robust, two-way conversations must be delivered in person, and the chief executive must invite and answer every question.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Empowerment Must Be Tied to P &amp; L</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s not what you say, but what you measure, repeatedly and transparently, that creates priorities and changes minds. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a reflection of an organization&rsquo;s true priorities. Establish KPIs that benchmark and monitor your definition of successful gender parity. These could include such variables as pay levels and attrition rates between men and women&nbsp;in similar functions and the ratio of women promoted to women eligible for promotion. These metrics must go beyond meeting arbitrary quotas and should become agenda items at board meetings, strategic planning sessions, and operational reviews to demonstrate progress to key stakeholders, including investors and employees.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Influence Must Be Anchored In All Directions - And Integrated into the Decision-Making Process.</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s crucial to create a top-down, peer-topeer, and bottom-up culture of meaningful influence for gender-equality practices and policies to succeed. Give people concrete methods and empowering conditions in which to make decisions and share their suggestions. Organizations must encourage open-membership action&nbsp;teams and think tanks and move quickly to implement positive change, regardless of where it originated.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. You must Identify Why Women (And Men) in the Workforce are silent about Gender Issues.</strong><br />\nPeople tend to go silent if they fear one of three things: retaliation, indifference, or disbelief. In order to influence a positive outcome, you must understand how and why the negative forces and whisper campaigns took root. What&rsquo;s the root cause of silence in your culture? Openness begets openness.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Leaders Must Engage In Battle Against Workplace Dominance.</strong><br />\nIt&rsquo;s crucial to fight destructive power plays and hissy fits at all levels.&nbsp;Misconduct isn&rsquo;t limited to high-profile leaders who assert their power and positions. A culture of dominance spills over to the rest of your organization. It manifests itself in departments and teams who assert their superiority over others. To ignore them leads to resentment and high turnover rates.<br />\n<br />\nOne bit of advice that I shared with leaders in the Middle East is that when females join the conversation they&rsquo;ve inspired and help lead it, lasting change will occur. The empowerment movement will only take hold when men and women lead it together.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s time we ended our comparative complacency in the U.S. along with the belief that we&rsquo;re somehow &ldquo;better&rdquo; than others, if not perfect. We&rsquo;re falling short of the initiatives that others are taking, and the situation won&rsquo;t get better unless we recognize that we all share this responsibility and take action with these five imperatives now.</p>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Where the Invisible Gorilla Went</strong><br />\n<br />\nHave you seen the invisible gorilla? No? You&rsquo;ve missed a phenomenon, then, a viral video sensation that pointed to the science being done on the nature of attention. I&rsquo;m not giving too much away when I say that the general conclusion is that we tend to overrate our ability to&nbsp;pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening. (We also overrate our ability to make rational decisions, to drive well, to not be sleep deprived and to avoid bias. In fact, we tend to overrate our ability to do pretty much everything; it&rsquo;s possibly one of the secrets to the human race&rsquo;s success.)&nbsp;One of the scientists behind the research, Chris Chabris, has shifted his own attention and is now working on the nature of collective intelligence. I learned about this when listening to an episode of the excellent You&rsquo;re Not So Smart podcast.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Question behind Collective Intelligence</strong><br />\nPeople have been attempting to codify and measure intelligence forever, the best-known metric being IQ: intelligence quotient. We all have a sense of what IQ is. Then there&rsquo;s EQ &mdash; that&rsquo;s ubiquitous. And there have been spluttering attempts to get MQ, BQ, CQ and PQ off the ground as well.<br />\n<br />\nBut while these all give us a bearing relative to other individuals, what makes for a more intelligent team? How do you make your team or working group smarter? Could it be as simple as finding a bunch of people with high IQs and throwing them together?<br />\n<br />\nWell, of course not. Using experiments that tested groups of two to five people, both in person and collaborating over the internet, Chabris&rsquo; research points to three factors that predict the smartness of teams.<br />\n<br />\n<em>1. Sharing the Stage</em><br />\nThe first factor is the extent to which the conversation is shared equally among all members of the team. The more each voice is heard equally, the smarter the team is collectively. It&rsquo;s a stunning finding when you think about how most workplaces operate. Not just the fact that teams tend to have the talker &mdash; the pontificator, the person who&rsquo;s overly confident about just how excellent their wisdom is &mdash; but, behind that, the continuing belief in the heroic, all-knowing leader whose job is to dispense wisdom and solve all problems.<br />\n<br />\nA leader who&rsquo;s willing to step away from the comfort of being the voice of authority and command, in order to facilitate different voices being heard, is a rare thing. And it's perhaps one reason Microsoft is having a bit of a renaissance, as its CEO starts to shirt the culture to allow just that.<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. Operating with Empathy</em><br />\nThe second factor is the level of empathy within the team. The more each member has what Chabris calls &ldquo;social sensitivity,&rdquo; the smarter its collective intelligence. As you accurately read the feelings of others and understand their states of mind, you make better decisions. So often, the instinct is to do the opposite: push down the emotion, focus on the data and the facts only (or more likely, your opinions about those facts)&nbsp;and assume you know what&rsquo;s going on. Data, of course, has its place, as does judgment, particularly when the two are teased apart and you know what&rsquo;s what. But operating with a sense of empathy enhances team wisdom.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3.Including Women</em><br />\nAnd the final factor? Having women on the team: the more there are on the team, the smarter the team is. Now, Chabris is very keen that we don&rsquo;t rush to big conclusions about this finding. He can&rsquo;t quite explain it, and so this is where you want to be really clear on the difference between correlation and causation.<br />\n<br />\nBut yes. The more women on the team, the greater its collective intelligence.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Silver Bullet for Creating Collective Intelligence</strong><br />\n<br />\nThere is one shift in leadership behaviour that drives two of the three factors and increases collective intelligence: enabling managers and leaders to be more coach-like.<br />\n<br />\nWhich is not quite the same thing as having them coach. Coaching often involves hiring an executive coach to come in and offer support, or running the occasional formal &ldquo;coaching session&rdquo; where a senior person coaches someone on their team. Being more coach-like, on the other hand, is an everyday way of behaving that can be used in any interaction. In its essence, it is simply this: staying curious a little longer, and rushing to action and advice-giving a little more slowly.<br />\n<br />\nHere are three tools to help managers build a coaching habit<br />\n<br />\n<em>1. Pick one good question (It Could Be the Awe Question)</em><br />\n<br />\nIf the goal of being more coach-like is to stay curious a little longer, then the engine of curiosity is a good question. There are hundreds of powerful questions to choose from, but rather than&nbsp;picking a hundred of them, pick just one. Get good at asking that one question really well, then add the next question to your repertoire.<br />\n<br />\nIf you&rsquo;d like some unsolicited advice on which question to start with, may I suggest &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; The AWE Question, as it&rsquo;s known, can be the most powerful coaching question in the world, for two reasons. First, the initial answer to a question is rarely the only one or the best one. And second, asking &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; keeps you curious and stops you from rushing into action mode. In other words, it&rsquo;s a self-management tool.<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. Make it a Habit</em><br />\n<br />\nWhat&rsquo;s hard about being more coach-like is not the theory but the practice. How do you shift the deep-seated behaviour of jumping in to offer an option, an answer, a solution? Good intentions get you nowhere. Habits, however, are the building blocks of behaviour change.<br />\n<br />\nThe Coaching Habit introduces the New Habit Formula, a simple three-part&nbsp;process that sets out the science and art of building a habit. Based on the work of people like Charles Duhigg and BJ Fogg, it asks you to define the trigger (the situation in which the habit occurs), the old behaviour you&rsquo;re looking to eliminate and a new behaviour (habit) you can do in 60 seconds or less.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3. Eliminate Fake Questions and Fake Listening</em><br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Have you thought of&hellip;?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Did you try&hellip;?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What about&hellip;?&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t actually questions. They&rsquo;re your advice, with a question mark tacked on at the end.<br />\n<br />\nSimilarly, that vigorous head-nodding and mmm-ing you do to signal to someone that you&rsquo;re listening intently when you&rsquo;re actually listening to your inner voice &mdash; that&rsquo;s not really listening.<br />\n<br />\nTune in and notice how sneaky those fake questions and fake listening are in your everyday conversations. Once you start noticing the trigger, you&rsquo;ll be able to build a new habit (see point 2, above) of asking questions and listening differently.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Who Doesn't Want a Stronger Team?</strong><br />\nChris Chabris&rsquo; work tells us that shared contribution, empathy and the inclusion of more women make for a smarter team.<br />\n<br />\nI can&rsquo;t do much in this article about gender balance.

          "textOnly": "<p><strong>Where the Invisible Gorilla Went</strong><br />\n<br />\nHave you seen the invisible gorilla? No? You&rsquo;ve missed a phenomenon, then, a viral video sensation that pointed to the science being done on the nature of attention. I&rsquo;m not giving too much away when I say that the general conclusion is that we tend to overrate our ability to&nbsp;pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening. (We also overrate our ability to make rational decisions, to drive well, to not be sleep deprived and to avoid bias. In fact, we tend to overrate our ability to do pretty much everything; it&rsquo;s possibly one of the secrets to the human race&rsquo;s success.)&nbsp;One of the scientists behind the research, Chris Chabris, has shifted his own attention and is now working on the nature of collective intelligence. I learned about this when listening to an episode of the excellent You&rsquo;re Not So Smart podcast.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Question behind Collective Intelligence</strong><br />\nPeople have been attempting to codify and measure intelligence forever, the best-known metric being IQ: intelligence quotient. We all have a sense of what IQ is. Then there&rsquo;s EQ &mdash; that&rsquo;s ubiquitous. And there have been spluttering attempts to get MQ, BQ, CQ and PQ off the ground as well.<br />\n<br />\nBut while these all give us a bearing relative to other individuals, what makes for a more intelligent team? How do you make your team or working group smarter? Could it be as simple as finding a bunch of people with high IQs and throwing them together?<br />\n<br />\nWell, of course not. Using experiments that tested groups of two to five people, both in person and collaborating over the internet, Chabris&rsquo; research points to three factors that predict the smartness of teams.<br />\n<br />\n<em>1. Sharing the Stage</em><br />\nThe first factor is the extent to which the conversation is shared equally among all members of the team. The more each voice is heard equally, the smarter the team is collectively. It&rsquo;s a stunning finding when you think about how most workplaces operate. Not just the fact that teams tend to have the talker &mdash; the pontificator, the person who&rsquo;s overly confident about just how excellent their wisdom is &mdash; but, behind that, the continuing belief in the heroic, all-knowing leader whose job is to dispense wisdom and solve all problems.<br />\n<br />\nA leader who&rsquo;s willing to step away from the comfort of being the voice of authority and command, in order to facilitate different voices being heard, is a rare thing. And it's perhaps one reason Microsoft is having a bit of a renaissance, as its CEO starts to shirt the culture to allow just that.<br />\n<br />\n<em>2. Operating with Empathy</em><br />\nThe second factor is the level of empathy within the team. The more each member has what Chabris calls &ldquo;social sensitivity,&rdquo; the smarter its collective intelligence. As you accurately read the feelings of others and understand their states of mind, you make better decisions. So often, the instinct is to do the opposite: push down the emotion, focus on the data and the facts only (or more likely, your opinions about those facts)&nbsp;and assume you know what&rsquo;s going on. Data, of course, has its place, as does judgment, particularly when the two are teased apart and you know what&rsquo;s what. But operating with a sense of empathy enhances team wisdom.<br />\n<br />\n<em>3.Including Women</em><br />\nAnd the final factor? Having women on the team: the more there are on the team, the smarter the team is. Now, Chabris is very keen that we don&rsquo;t rush to big conclusions about this finding. He can&rsquo;t quite explain it, and so this is where you want to be really clear on the difference between correlation and causation.<br />\n<br />\nBut yes.

It&rsquo;s about holding yourself accountable; to be open to ridicule, praise, and personal attack in the pursuit to uphold and create a great culture.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Smart Leaders Hire Smart People</strong><br />\nEven though most people have a fear of being outshone, surround yourself with people who are smarter than yourself. Do not attribute education to good judgment because even the most incredibly educated people don&rsquo;t always know how to make the right decisions. Do not underestimate the ability of the human mind to rationalize because character is not a consequence of several different acts, it&rsquo;s a product of consistency and people upholding their word.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Be Accountable</strong><br />\nA leader needs to take extreme accountability on consequential decisions. For example, Barack Obama was willing to put his career on the line in the case of Osama Bin Laden to ensure that psychological and physical terrorist networks were brought down.<br />\n<br />\n&ldquo;Leadership is making the decisions and owning them.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Lead By Your Decisions</strong><br />\nLeaders need to make the tough decisions. That means taking all the facts and understanding all the perspectives. It also means taking the blame for the consequences of your actions, understanding the risks, and sharing the praise when it&rsquo;s due.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What Leadership Really Means</strong><br />\nThe people who change the culture are the people who take risks and make themselves vulnerable to criticism, in hopes of changing the culture, shifting the norm, and setting an example for the rest of the world. Leadership means that you understand that what you are doing is a call of duty; what you do is bigger than just yourself or for your own monetary gain. Ask yourself what value do you have that you are willing to lose in order to succeed and stay true to what you say you are about? How can you be the leader that you want to be and say you are?<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

      "description": "<p>One November day in 2012, in his second season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Canadian Tristan Thompson was goofing around on the court after a morning shoot-around practice when his teammate Jeremy Pargo challenged him to a shooting contest with a difference: both of them had to shoot with their weak hands. Thompson, a leftie, won so effortlessly that Pargo said he should shoot with his right hand all the time. Thompson didn&rsquo;t take the remark seriously. But a week later, he and his coaches decided to try a little test. His right-handed shots were noticeably smoother and more accurate. Wait a sec. Had he been shooting with the wrong hand for the past twelve years?<br />\n<br />\nNo NBA player has switched shooting hands midway through his career. Ever. When Jeremy Pargo first floated the notion, Thompson wouldn&rsquo;t entertain it&mdash;even after Pargo opined that switching could transform him from a strong player into an all-star. Thompson&rsquo;s first reaction, he later recalled, was to say, &ldquo;Shut up, man. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I got to the NBA left-handed. I&rsquo;m going&nbsp;to stick in the NBA left-handed.&rdquo; Pargo&rsquo;s comment, though, had jolted Thompson, and the more he weighed the pros and cons, the more he came around to the idea that at least trying to change his shooting hand might make sense.<br />\n<br />\nIf he could train his right hand to shoot more accurately than his left, he could take his game to a whole new level. &ldquo;I wanted to take on that challenge. I knew I could keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing and have a good career and make a lot of money,&rdquo; he told a reporter. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be good. I want to be great.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\nBut changing shooting hands wasn&rsquo;t a mere tweak or a tune-up. It was a potentially destabilizing move that could sideline him before he&rsquo;d really made his mark. He had a few things going for him, though: he appeared to be ambidextrous, writing with his left hand but holding his toothbrush with his right. And if things didn&rsquo;t pan out, he could always go back to shooting with his left.<br />\n<br />\nImmediately after the Cavs&rsquo; season wrapped in the spring of 2013, Tristan Thompson and coach Dave Love began working together, first in the Cleveland practice facility and later in Miami, Houston, and Toronto. The switch started with drills &hellip; slow, repetitive, mind-numbingly boring drills designed to eliminate every last whisper of superfluous movement from Thompson&rsquo;s shot and force him to focus on the last snap of his wrist before the ball left his hand. The goal was to get the index finger of his right hand to draw an arc straight down from the ceiling to the net. Placing that one finger in precisely the right place is, in Love&rsquo;s view, absolutely critical to getting the ball to leave your hand in exactly the right way. And drilling is the only way to make the movement effortless and automatic, so that a player can deliver in the heat of a game. So Thompson performed each drill, over and over, standing close to the hoop&mdash;four hundred snaps of the wrists every workout, two workouts every day.<br />\n<br />\nSince Thompson began playing at the age of eleven, Love calculated, he had probably taken more than a million left-handed shots. Switching hands, then, would be like going back in time to his middle-school self. &ldquo;You have the experience of an eleven-year-old right now,&rdquo; Love told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;work as hard as we can, but no matter how good I am or how hard we work, we can&rsquo;t jam all those years of experience into four months.&rdquo; A change of this magnitude was going to take time.<br />\n<br />\nAs the research makes clear, change isn&rsquo;t what occurs at the moment we start exercising, or stop drinking, or leave a relationship, or go back to school, or get a new job. There&rsquo;s a long lead-up to that moment, a process that kicks off well before there are any concrete signs of progress and continues long after it&rsquo;s clear that progress is occurring. It&rsquo;s a very long game, and that&rsquo;s why the ability to withstand discomfort&mdash;or better yet, embrace it&mdash;is so crucial.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSo much of basketball is instinctual, but Love was essentially coaching Thompson to abandon the automatic reflexes that had made him a first-round draft pick. He wanted him to be more &ldquo;un-athletic&rdquo; during their sessions: to take a split second before shooting and use it to stop, position himself properly, and put the ball in the right place. Like any basketball player, Thompson was accustomed to constant motion, not just up and down the court but side to&nbsp;side as he passed and dribbled. Now his shooting coach wanted him to be as motionless as possible in the split second before initiating his shot so he could be sure his hands were exactly where they needed to be. It was as if the star of an action movie were being asked to hit the pause button for a nanosecond as he leapt from a burning building.<br />\n<br />\nLove asks his players to pay close attention to their bad habits&mdash;not a huge surprise, really, because in a sense the players he works with have become addicted to shooting a certain way. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t focus on performing the movement right,&rdquo; he tells them, &ldquo;but on catching yourself doing it wrong.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a fine line, though, because he doesn&rsquo;t want them to overthink things. If they do, they&rsquo;ll freeze. It happens all the time at the free-throw line, to players who&rsquo;ve spent thousands of hours practising.<br />\n<br />\nNBA players who can tolerate the discomfort of change tend to be rewarded rather handsomely. Tristan Thompson certainly was. He worked with Love until June 2014, and in the 2014&ndash;15 season his field goal percentage was 54.7 percent. The next year, it climbed to 58.8 percent&mdash;15 percent higher than it had been in his first season. Although still not known for his shooting&mdash;he&rsquo;s become much more accurate from the freethrow line and is an even more effective offensive rebounder. Thompson&rsquo;s gamble on greatness seems to have paid off: two years after he switched to shooting with his right hand, the Cavs signed him to a five-year US$82-million contract. And the year after that, the team won the NBA championship for the first time ever, with Thompson &ldquo;doing the dirty work&rdquo; of defence, as he put it, and effectively shutting down two of the most feared sharpshooters in the game, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, whenever he guarded them.<br />\n<br />\nHave fun along the way, Love tells his players&mdash;but don&rsquo;t stop the drills, because you&rsquo;re never going to arrive at your destination. There will always be room for improvement. &ldquo;Even Steph Curry, possibly the greatest shooter ever to live, probably still thinks, &lsquo;Aw, man, there are a lot of open shots that I missed. I should be making those shots!&rsquo;&rdquo; If so, maybe Love could help. Stranger things have already happened.</p>",

The first secret is that often we are told that if we do great work, it will lead to big success, and then we will be happy. Psychologically proven, this is backwards and we need to be happy first. After 300 positive psychology studies, Neil says that when we are happy we are 31% more productive, have 37x higher sales, are more engaged, are 40% more likely to get a promotion in the next year and tend to live ten years longer.</p>\n<p><br />\n<strong>2. The \"Big 5\" to Happiness</strong><br />\n<br />\nTo become happy, perform the &ldquo;Big 5&rdquo;. Any of these done for just 20 minutes for 20 days will have results: three brisk nature-walks a week, journaling, performing five conscious acts of kindness a week, meditating, and five gratitudes a week.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Automate, Regulate, Effectuate, Debate</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe second secret is to draw a matrix of time and importance for the 295 decisions we make every single day. Decisions that are low time and low importance, automate (i.e. make extra dinner so that you have lunch made for you the next day). Decisions that are low importance but high time, regulate (i.e. devote the first Monday of every month to house maintenance). Things that are high importance and low time, effectuate (i.e. picking up your kids). Decisions of high importance and high time is where we have now made more room for debate.

Actions</strong><strong>Leads</strong> <strong>to Motivation</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe third secret is to turn your biggest fear into your biggest success. We think there are three steps to everything we do: we can do it, we want to do it, and so we do it. We think that capability and motivation leads to action, but action actually leads to motivation. It is easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking, than think yourself into a new way of acting.</p>",

Humour is giving, it&rsquo;s generous. Comedy subtracts and is usually sarcastic or biting. That&rsquo;s why humour is better suited to marketing. To make someone smile, or laugh, forges an emotional connection. Humour gathers people. Think about people you know. The ones who make you smile are the ones you most want to be around. Humour doesn't pursue, it pulls.<br />\n<br />\nNot long ago, I attended a talk given by filmmaker Richard Curtis at the Cannes advertising festival. Curtis is a very successful screen-writer and director whose credits include Mr. Bean, Blackadder, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, Bridget Jones&rsquo;s Diary, and Notting Hill, to name but a few. Not a bad resum&eacute;. He was in Cannes to unveil a new marketing campaign he was spearheading to tackle extreme poverty and climate change. The campaign was going to begin with a cinema ad that would be shown on the same day in every movie theatre in North America and Europe. It would be the first global cinema ad ever done. When Curtis previewed the ad during his talk, the press was surprised that its treatment of extreme poverty and climate change was humorous. Didn&rsquo;t the subject matter call for a more serious tone?<br />\n<br />\nHere&rsquo;s what Curtis said: In his early days as a writer on Blackadder, he realized the only way to get the audience to remem- ber an important plot point was to attach it to humour. So if Sir Nigel Ridgley was coming for dinner, few people would remem- ber that beat. But if Sir Nigel Fatbottom was coming, no one forgot. Humour made it stick.<br />\n<br />\nNow, humour isn&rsquo;t the only answer to effective marketing, but it illustrates the rule. Emotional content makes people care. That said, most learning institutions&nbsp;put much more value on intellectual reasoning than they do on emotion. Yet emotion fuels the world. Even in a math-and-science-driven institution like NASA, the decision to go to the moon wasn&rsquo;t driven by rational facts. It was propelled by the emotion of John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s challenge of landing a man on the moon by 1970 to prove American superiority. Throughout the 1960s, NASA continually marketed the moonshot with emotion. It signed an ongoing contract with Life magazine to feature full-colour stories on the astronauts and their families; it framed the new satellite communications technology and even the small RCA cameras the astronauts took onboard as innovations that would have a beneficial impact on the daily lives of Americans. Maybe the most emotional pitch was the one that warned of letting the Russians (read: Communists) control outer space, dropping bombs on America &ldquo;like kids dropping rocks from a highway bridge.&rdquo; That pitch alone persuaded the government to keep signing those big cheques.<br />\n<br />\nThe space organization needed the support not only of Congress, but also of the American public. Landing men on the moon was going to be the most expensive endeavour America had ever undertaken, totalling over $170 billion in today&rsquo;s dollars (and by the way, there was an expensive war going on in Vietnam). If the decision to go had been based strictly on logic, it never would have happened. Emotion made the difference. America felt invested in the outcome.<br />\n<br />\nWhen companies like Duncan Hines marketed instant cake mixes after World War II, all you needed to do was add water and two eggs. It was a big hit with homemakers, but then in the 1950s, sales started to drop off dramatically. As time wore on, women stopped enjoying the quick baking mix. They felt unfulfilled by the process. It was too easy. It felt like they were cheating their families. The product that was created for ultimate convenience became too convenient.<br />\n<br />\nSo what did brands like Duncan Hines do to turn sales around? The secret was to make homemakers feel like bakers. It was literally the icing on the cake. The company showed cooks (read: women) how to add decadent frosting&mdash;not just to the top, but also between each layer and all around the cake. That suggestion made them feel like they were truly baking. With that, cake mix sales soared again. As a matter of fact, the photo of a frosted cake became one of the defining advertising images of that era.

      "description": "<p>As the business landscape in Canada continues to become increasingly competitive, organizations are looking to better understand productivity and how it impacts their bottom line. As Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman, in his critically-acclaimed book The Age of Diminishing Expectations said, &ldquo;Productivity isn&rsquo;t everything, but in the long run, it is almost everything. A country&rsquo;s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Recent evaluations of productivity levels among G7 countries, conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), ranked Canada as the second-least productive country overall.

Besides serving as the 47th Vice-President to former President Barack Obama, Joe Biden is a man whose post-White House life and work is more public than ever. He refuses to allow personal hardship&nbsp;and sorrow to slow him down.</p>\n<p>After more than 45 years spent fulfilling his public duty as Vice President and United States Senator, one could be forgiven for thinking that Vice President Biden might be considering retirement. However, &ldquo;Joe Biden has always been a man with boundless energy, and he&rsquo;ll never quit,&rdquo; says Bruce Reed, his former chief of staff. &ldquo;He would be doing all he&rsquo;s doing no matter what his plans are. He&rsquo;s not the retiring kind.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This year is turning out to be one of Biden&rsquo;s busiest yet. Biden and his wife of 40 years, Dr. Jill Biden, recently launched a project that is very near and dear to their hearts called The Biden Foundation, a non-profit organization that will continue Biden&rsquo;s vision to champion progress and prosperity for American families.</p>\n<p>November will also see the release of Biden&rsquo;s memoir, Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose,&nbsp;Biden&rsquo;s own personal story about how hope, purpose, and action can become a guide through the pain of personal loss. A 19-city book tour will coincide with the launch.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Failure at some point in everyone&rsquo;s life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable,&rdquo; Biden quipped in his 2008 Convention speech. Giving up is certainly not in this man&rsquo;s DNA. In 1972, as senator-elect, Biden&rsquo;s wife Neilia was driving with their 3 children when her car was fatally struck by a tractor-trailer. Both she and their 1-year old daughter Naomi did not survive the accident, while their sons, Beau and Hunter were seriously injured and hospitalized for some period afterward.</p>\n<p>Despite his unforgiving heartbreak, Senator Biden resolved to continue his public duty to the American people while balancing the duties of a single father dedicated to filling the void left in his sons&rsquo; lives.</p>\n<p>This early personal devastation set the stage for Biden&rsquo;s deep commitment to family and faith. In 2014, Joe and Jill Biden&rsquo;s eldest son, Beau, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Beau&rsquo;s death struck a huge blow to the family. &ldquo;Promise me, Dad,&rdquo; Beau had told his father. &ldquo;Give me your word that no matter what happens, you&rsquo;re going to be all right.&rdquo; Joe Biden gave him his word.</p>\n<p>Promise Me, Dad is an account of the challenging year that followed. In the memoir, Biden opens his world to readers to share those days of grief when he was treading water, unable to&nbsp;move forward and why he knew in his heart that action was the only way to leave behind his personal loss. &ldquo;I hope my own story will strike a chord with other Americans who have walked the same path I have.&rdquo; While still deeply in mourning, Biden decided not to run for President in 2016. In the memoir, he also promises to reveal his reasons for not running for President.</p>\n<p>Biden will continue, as he has his entire career, to split his time between Washington D.C. and Delaware so that his wife Jill can continue teaching English at a community college in Northern Virginia. Dr. Jill Biden spent more than 30 years as an educator and has been a leader on the importance of community colleges, military families and the rights and welfare of women and girls.</p>\n<p>The former Vice President has established research and policy centers at both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Delaware. The Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement and the Biden Institute each focus on the issues&mdash; Foreign and domestic, respectively&mdash; that have animated his storied career. And on the political front, Biden has vowed to remain active through his American Possibilities PAC, supporting groups and causes that dream big and focus on what is possible in America.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more optimistic than I&rsquo;ve ever been since I&rsquo;ve been in public life,&rdquo; Biden said in the Foundation&rsquo;s launch video. &ldquo;As long as we have a breath in&nbsp;us, we&rsquo;re going to be working on it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Biden Foundation is working to carry on a lifetime of public service, including the continuation of the Biden Cancer Initiative, ensuring that the Violence Against Women Act is &ldquo;fully realized,&rdquo; supporting American military members and their families, and increasing access to high-quality and affordable education.</p>\n<p>As a man long associated with the words integrity, compassion, and authenticity, could the &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; circus that has blown into D.C. become the motivation for a Joe Biden Presidential run in 2020?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of running for president, but I&rsquo;m a great respecter of fate,&rdquo; Joe told NPR. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any plans to do it, but I&rsquo;m not promising I wouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>",

      "description": "<p>This observation came from John W. Gardner - former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under President Lyndon Johnson - in his book, On Leadership, published in 1990.<br />\n<br />\nCaught in the throes of the Cold War, Gardner understood that society would never truly evolve without strong leaders. The same holds true today despite the fact that the world is now much different than it was 30 years ago.<br />\n<br />\nWhether it&rsquo;s a seismic change driven by digital disruption, fundamental shifts in how or where we work, the threat posed by climate change, or the increasing globalization of our economy, leaders must be able to navigate a broader, more complex array of challenges than ever before.<br />\n<br />\nAnd leadership has definitely evolved to keep up. Today, it is more distributed throughout an organization, from the C-suite all the way down to the frontlines. All roles matter, not just&nbsp;a few at the top.

This includes the ways we work and learn, and how we identify and develop leaders. Big data will drive leadership analytics to help organizations better predict those individuals who are truly cut out for&nbsp;leadership and those who will succeed vs fail. We will need measures to gauge which leaders are truly able to be agile, and able to anticipate and make sense of their world and respond accordingly. Then as the world changes, they need to be able to do it all over again.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>WORK REINVENTED</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe evolution of the gig economy will generate new challenges for those in leadership roles charged with recruiting and developing talent. Many studies suggest up to 50 percent of all jobs will disappear over the next twenty-five years. Robots or other forms of technology will replace many of these jobs. Some will simply never be replaced. In a scenario like this, who will be left to lead? In a world where the very nature of work is being redefined, there will be a heavy burden on leaders to create meaningful work experiences for the people they lead. The risks of gig work are that it becomes piecework&mdash;devoid of meaning. Creating an inspiring environment in which to work will be even more critical in the future. Culture will continue to matter and we'll need leaders who get that.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>ROBOTICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</strong><br />\n<br />\nDecision-making tools can complement and support the work of leaders. Or, if some innovators have their way, these tools could actually replace leaders altogether.

While&nbsp;it&rsquo;s important to be careful on the conclusions drawn from some of this research, it will be important to pay attention to it.

      "description": "<p>Life really is too short to be unhappy at work. Yet far too many of us aren&rsquo;t even close to being content&mdash;much less delighted&mdash;with our work or our workplaces. Instead, we are stressed and exhausted. We can&rsquo;t remember what we used to love about our jobs. Colleagues we trust and respect are few and far between, and half the time it doesn&rsquo;t even feel safe to be ourselves. All of this is spilling over into our personal lives. We&rsquo;re having a hard time sleeping or have given up on exercise. Relationships are suffering, too. We feel trapped and struggle to see how things will get better. No one wants to live like this. Still, a lot of us give up and settle for less-than-fulfilling jobs. We tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re not supposed to be happy at work; that&rsquo;s for other parts of life. We try to cope by avoiding that bad manager or getting that stubborn, annoying person off the team. We shut down, give less, and fantasize about&nbsp;telling someone off. Sometimes we run away from the job, the company, even our careers. But running away isn&rsquo;t going to make things better. To be happy, I&rsquo;ve discovered, you&rsquo;ve got to run toward something: meaningful work; a hopeful, inspiring vision of your future; and good relationships with the people you work with every day.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Happiness Begins with Purpose and Meaningful Work</strong><br />\n<br />\nWe are wired to seek meaning in everything we do. It&rsquo;s what makes us human. In some cases, it&rsquo;s what keeps us alive. In his classic book, Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning, Austrian psychiatrist and holocaust survivor Victor Frankl shows that even in the worst of circumstances, purpose, hope, and connection are what keep us going. True, his story of finding good in evil and pursuing a noble purpose in spite of the horrors of life in&nbsp;concentration camps is nothing short of heroic. Yet, as Frankl so eloquently shows us, we strive to find meaning in our day-to-day lives no matter where we are or what conditions we are subjected to. As you have probably discovered, you can easily lose sight of what you value and ignore the aspects of yourself that matter most to you, especially when you&rsquo;re struggling with dysfunctional organizations, bad bosses, and stress. You&rsquo;re then likely to put meaning and purpose on the back burner or wait for someone else to give you a compelling reason to love your job. Couple all this with the outdated but pervasive notions that personal values don&rsquo;t belong in the workplace, and you have a recipe for disengagement and unhappiness. You need the conviction to insist on living your purpose at work. As you will see in this book, the effort is worthwhile. Having a sound, clear, and compelling purpose helps you be stronger, more resilient,&nbsp;and able to tap into your knowledge and talents. As you discover which parts of your job are truly fulfilling&mdash;and which are soul destroying&mdash;you will be in a better position to make good choices about how you spend your time and what you pursue in your career.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Hope&rsquo;s Contribution to Happiness</strong><br />\n<br />\nLike meaning, hope is an essential part of our human experience. This is as true at work as in any corner of our lives. Hope, optimism, and a vision of a future that is better than today help us rise above trials and deal with setbacks. Hope fuels energy, creativity, and resilience. Hope makes it possible to navigate complexity, deal with pressure, prioritize, and make sense of our crazy organizations and work lives. And hope inspires us to reach our potential&mdash; something virtually everyone wants for themselves. Unfortunately, we often assume that our organization&rsquo;s vision is enough to keep us hopeful and focused on the future. I&rsquo;ve rarely seen this to be the case. An organization&rsquo;s vision, however inspiring, is for the organization&mdash;not you. Even the noblest organizational visions seldom speak to our most cherished, personal hopes and dreams. To be truly happy at work, we need to see how our work responsibilities and opportunities fit with a personal vision of our future. This kind of vision is vitally tied to hope and optimism, which we can, with focus and hard work, cultivate even in difficult jobs and toxic workplaces. When we see our jobs through a positive lens, and when a personal vision is at the front and centre in our minds, we are more likely to learn from challenges and even failures, rather than be destroyed by them. With hope, optimism, and a personal vision, we can actively choose a path toward happiness&mdash;a path away from disengagement, cynicism and despair.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Friendships and Happiness at Work</strong><br />\n<br />\nResonant relationships are at the heart of collective success in our companies. That&rsquo;s because strong, trusting,&nbsp;authentic relationships form the basis for great collaboration and collective success. But, I&rsquo;ve found, we need more than trust and authenticity to get us through good times and bad. We need to feel that people care about us and we want to care for them in return. This, too, is part of our human makeup. We also want to feel as if we are accepted for who we are, and that we work in a group, team, or organization that makes us feel proud and inspires us to give our best effort. Adding it all up, the kind of relationships we want and need look a lot like friendships. Yet, one of the most pernicious myths in today&rsquo;s organizations is that you don&rsquo;t have to be friends with your coworkers. Common sense and my decades of work with people and companies show the exact opposite. Love and a sense of belonging at work are as necessary as the air we breathe. Purpose, hope, and friendships don&rsquo;t just appear magically. You need to work for them. You need to engage in mindful self-reflection and be truthful about what you discover. Then you need to act. This is where your emotional intelligence comes in.<br />\n<br />\nWe&rsquo;ve known for years that emotional intelligence (EI) is key to being effective at work. The more EI you have, the better you are at your job&mdash;no matter what kind of role you have or how senior you are. What&rsquo;s clear to me now is that EI also affects your ability to find and sustain happiness. EI enables conscious reflection and action&mdash;that magic combination that keeps you from running from one unhappy situation to the next. In practical terms, EI is a set of competencies that enable you to understand your own and others&rsquo; feelings, and then use this knowledge to act in ways that support your own and others&rsquo; effectiveness. Moreover, EI will help you tune in to a purpose and hope to establish friendly, resonant relationships at work.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you decide to look within yourself to connect with what&rsquo;s most important to you, what makes you feel hopeful about the future, and what you long for in your relationships, you are taking that first, all-important step toward a work life that is deeply satisfying, challenging, and fun. With conviction and practice, you can be happy and successful&mdash; and love your work.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p>I confess: I&rsquo;m a sucker for life hacks.</p>\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t fantasize about getting work done faster and getting more out of life, especially when, after rushing around all day, you&rsquo;ve barely made a dent in your to-do list, emails keep pouring in, and that one big project you&rsquo;ve been meaning to work on gets kicked to the following week?</p>\n<p>Some of the advice for working smarter is excellent, and developing the right productivity skills is critical. But both have their limits. In truth, all the life hacks in the world can only get you so far. Because both the problem and the solution to doing better work so you have more time for life are bigger than just you&mdash;possibly a lot bigger.</p>\n<p>According to a new report by the behavioural-science research group ideas42 and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and a resource book I contributed to, it all comes down to systems change: What if instead of expecting workers to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; themselves on their own, we designed work environments that led everyone to make better choices?</p>\n<p><strong>YOU&rsquo;RE REALLY DOING THREE KINDS OF WORK</strong></p>\n<p>Change is hard for humans. We tend toward what behavioural science researchers call &ldquo;status quo bias,&rdquo; which is exactly what it sounds like: We do things a certain way because they&rsquo;ve always been done that way, often without question. We can get stuck in unhealthy patterns, even when we know better.</p>\n<p>That bias is making work itself too complicated. Technology is changing the nature of work&mdash;take group messaging apps like Slack and HipChat for instance&mdash;but often only by fits and starts; many workplaces that have brought in new tools have yet to let go of older ones. And those they do institute may not be implemented very well. Flexible work policies now let more people work different schedules in different locations, which heightens the need to communicate digitally.

But both have their limits. In truth, all the life hacks in the world can only get you so far. Because both the problem and the solution to doing better work so you have more time for life are bigger than just you&mdash;possibly a lot bigger.</p>\n<p>According to a new report by the behavioural-science research group ideas42 and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and a resource book I contributed to, it all comes down to systems change: What if instead of expecting workers to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; themselves on their own, we designed work environments that led everyone to make better choices?</p>\n<p><strong>YOU&rsquo;RE REALLY DOING THREE KINDS OF WORK</strong></p>\n<p>Change is hard for humans. We tend toward what behavioural science researchers call &ldquo;status quo bias,&rdquo; which is exactly what it sounds like: We do things a certain way because they&rsquo;ve always been done that way, often without question. We can get stuck in unhealthy patterns, even when we know better.</p>\n<p>That bias is making work itself too complicated. Technology is changing the nature of work&mdash;take group messaging apps like Slack and HipChat for instance&mdash;but often only by fits and starts; many workplaces that have brought in new tools have yet to let go of older ones. And those they do institute may not be implemented very well. Flexible work policies now let more people work different schedules in different locations, which heightens the need to communicate digitally.

      "description": "<div>\n <p>The year was 2006. Ford Motor Company was on the brink of bankruptcy, and its culture was completely broken&mdash;employees and executives alike were engulfed by secrecy, competitiveness, and paranoia. Ford&rsquo;s only hope, it seemed, was their brand-new CEO&mdash;a spirited, redhaired Kansan with a track record of turnarounds. Alan Mulally arrived at Ford after single-handedly saving Boeing&rsquo;s Commercial Airplane division, and he intended to do the same at his new company, starting with the executive team.</p>\n <p>Mulally&rsquo;s first move was instituting a weekly meeting he called the Business ProcessReview, or BPR. It wouldbeheldat the samedayandtime, and would be mandatory for his executives. They&rsquo;d review 320 metrics, each of which would beassignedacolor: green if it was on track, yellow if it had potential problems, and red if it had definite ones.The purpose of the BPR, Mulally</p>\n <p>The purpose of the BPR, Mulally explained, was awareness: to ensure everyone knew the plan, the status of that plan, and the reality of the challenges they faced. He emphasized that no one should hesitate to surface problems, nor would anyone be punished for telling the truth.</p>\n <p>On the morning of the first BPR, Mulally&rsquo;s team nervously streamed into the room, many with lieutenants in tow and all toting heavy three-ring binders. They took their seats at the large wooden conference table, and Mulally called the meeting to order.</p>\n <p>First, he repeated his vision: People working together as a lean global enterprise for automotive leadership. To get there, he reminded them, they&rsquo;d have to know everything that was going on in the business. &ldquo;We need to have everybody involved,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;We need to be aware. And we&rsquo;ll work together to turn the reds to yellow and then to green.&rdquo;</p>\n <p>After the first several BPRs, the team settled into a rhythm. Unfortunately, the process still left something to be desired. Miraculously, every chart that every executive presented in every BPR was&hellip;green.</p>\n <p>One day, Mulally decided he&rsquo;d had enough. &ldquo;Guys,&rdquo; he said, interrupting the meeting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to lose seventeen billion dollars this year and all the charts are green. Do you think there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s not going well? We can&rsquo;t manage a secret. We have to help each other.&rdquo;</p>\n <p>A thick and itchy silence filled the room. The executives knew exactly what would happen to the first who showed a red slide: the family portrait on their desk would be at the bottom of a cardboard box before lunch. Nevertheless, the days passed and the drill remained the same.</p>\n <p>Just weeks away from the launch of Ford&rsquo;s first crossover, the Edge, mechanics discovered a problem with the actuator. This left the executive responsible, Mark Fields, with no option but to halt production. He was sure it would cost him his job.</p>\n <p>But Fields figured he&rsquo;d do his colleagues one final favor: he&rsquo;d call Mulally&rsquo;s bluff. Somebody has to figure out if this guy is for real, he thought. If I go out, it might as well be in a blaze of glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n <p>The Moment of Truth</p>\n <p>When Mark Fields walked into the BPR, he had no idea how things would play out. Best-case? He&rsquo;d get reamed out but keep his job. Worst case? He&rsquo;d get reamed out and be shown the door.</p>\n <p>Never did it dawn on him that there was another possible outcome.</p>\n <p>Fields&rsquo; turn came. Up went the red slide. And WHOOM&mdash;the air left the room. He cleared his throat. &ldquo;On the Edge, we have an actuator issue, so we had to delay the launch.&rdquo; The entire room cringed as one.</p>\n <p>Then came a surprising sound: Alan Mulally&rsquo;s exuberant applause. &ldquo;Mark, this is great visibility!&rdquo; he grinned. Turning to his team, he asked, &ldquo;What can we do to help him out?&rdquo; One of the executives suggested a solution, and they were off and running.</p>\n <p>Mulally was optimistic that a new day had finally dawned. Yet the next week, to his great disappointment, the slides were still green. But that day, the team saw something that spoke volumes. Mark Fields was sitting right next to a smiling Mulally. Not only had he not been fired, he had been rewarded.</p>\n <p>The battle-weary executives now had the proof they needed. Sure enough, the following week, their PowerPoint decks were glorious rainbows of reds and yellows.</p>\n <p>According to Mulally, this was the single defining moment in Ford&rsquo;s turnaround.</p>\n <p>The Power of Self-Aware Teams</p>\n <p>Before Mulally arrived at Ford, his executives had been afraid to surface problems; to tell each other the truth; to give and receive honest feedback. The same things that had kept them mum about the realities of the business also kept them mum about their individual contributions, team dysfunctions, and cultural challenges.</p>\n <p>But Mulally&rsquo;s effort&mdash;and Fields&rsquo; leap of faith&mdash;helped the team confront reality. They&rsquo;d finally become self-aware. And the results speak for themselves. By 2009, amidst the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, Ford was back in the black (and took no government bailout money). By 2011, profit exceeded $20 billion. It was their second-most profitable year ever.</p>\n <p>If being individually self-aware means understanding who we are and how others see us, a self-aware team commits to that same understanding at a collective level. In my three year study of individual and team self-awareness, I&rsquo;ve discovered five categories of information that self-aware teams regularly assess and address:</p>\n <p>Objectives: What are they trying to achieve?<br />\n Progress: How are they doing?<br />\n Processes: Is the approach to achieve their objectives working?<br />\n Assumptions: Do their conclusions about the business and environment hold true?<br />\n Individual contributions: What impact is each team member having on the team&rsquo;s performance?<br />\n Three Tips for a More Self-Aware Team</p>\n <p>Even though self-aware teams are more efficient, effective, innovative, and rewarding to be a part of, few begin that way. But, as Alan Mulally can attest, with the right approach and a true ongoing commitment, leaders can foster a culture that encourages communication and feedback at all levels; one where honesty trumps hierarchy and even the lowest-ranking member feels safe surfacing problems.</p>\n <p>1) A leader who models the way</p>\n <p>Mulally believes that when it comes to creating self-aware teams, &ldquo;how far you get is completely dependent on the leader&rsquo;s self-awareness.&rdquo; At the most basic level, leaders must see themselves clearly. They should understand their values, passions, aspirations, personality, strengths and weaknesses, and impact on others. On top of that inner clarity, they need to be willing to communicate it to their team&mdash;and freely admit that they are not, in fact, perfect.</p>\n <p>2) Shake things up and strike for productive conflict</p>\n <p>Members of excessively harmonious teams avoid speaking up for fear of rocking the boat. Author Patrick Lencioni praises the virtue of what he calls &ldquo;productive conflict,&rdquo; where teams can productively put issues on the table and challenge one another in the spirit of success. One simple approach is appointing a &ldquo;team devil&rsquo;s advocate,&rdquo; whose job is to challenge the status quo during meetings.</p>\n <p>3) Create ongoing processes to stay self-aware</p>\n <p>One of Alan Mulally&rsquo;s secret weapons in transforming Fordwere his BPRs. Similarly, self-aware teams create regular processes to honestly evaluate their objectives, progress, process, assumptions, and individual contributions. At a bare minimum, this should be done monthly, but weekly is probably better.</p>\n</div>",

      "summary": "<p>How do you build your sales team? Can you be sure that it has the best possible talent? Here are the 7 essential skills crucial to a successful sales team, from self-motivation, to persistence.</p>",
      "description": "<p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">As a sales leader, making hiring decisions can be very challenging, but necessary task. From being the right fit for your team, to having strong characteristics of a successful salesperson, there are many factors to consider.</span></p>\n<p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">While we tend to focus on the individual skills necessary to be successful within sales, the skills that make up a great team are equally as important. The best sales teams are those made up of driven individuals who work together in order to accomplish great things. In order to help you make the right hiring decisions, we've outlined the top seven skills to look for to build a strong sales team.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">1. SELF-MOTIVATING</span></h4>\n<p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">In a way, what you accomplish while working in sales is entirely up to the individual and the team at large. The number of calls a team is making in the course of a day, the quotas they are setting for themselves, all come down to how hard they are willing to work and how well they are able to push themselves towards bigger achievements. The best sales teams are those that are driven and self-motivating, that take the initiative and push themselves further as a team.</span></p>\n<div>\n <h4 class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">2. CONFIDENT</span></h4>\n <p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Sales reps aren&rsquo;t just selling a product or a service when they&rsquo;re on a sales call&mdash;they&rsquo;re selling the pitch itself. If your team lacks confidence in their abilities, customers will notice and they won&rsquo;t be encouraged to have faith in a product or a team that seems to have so little in themselves. Confidence is so important, and remains one of the top sales skills because of its ability to impact so much else.</span></p>\n <h4 class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">3. PREPARED&nbsp;</span></h4>\n <p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">The most successful sales teams are diligent; they don&rsquo;t go into a sales call blindly. Instead, they do meticulous research and plan ahead for the different directions in which the sales call might go. Every customer is different; the one-size-fits-all script doesn&rsquo;t exist. For that reason, preparation should always be a priority &mdash;it&rsquo;s one of the top sales skills sales teams need to have.</span></p>\n <div>\n  <h4 class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">4. COLLABORATIVE</span></h4>\n  <p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">One thing all successful sales teams have in common is a strong sense of cohesion as a group. While sales might traditionally be portrayed as a job that stresses individual accomplishments, the reality is that collaboration is one of the top sales skills that all high-functioning sales teams have. Collaborating with each other and with those in other departments can help teams as a whole develop their skills and increase their sales.</span></p>\n  <h4 class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">5. ACTIVE LISTENERS</span></h4>\n  <p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Listening is one of those skills that is stressed again and again, but for good reason. Active listening is one of the most essential sales skills that a team can have if it is going to achieve great things. Active listening means actually listening to what the customer needs and responding to those needs in a way that benefits both parties.</span></p>\n  <h4 class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">6. MULTI-TASKING</span></h4>\n  <p>Working in sales is so much more complicated than just making a sales call and moving product. It involves careful planning, prospecting, problem solving, and selling all rolled in to one.</p>\n  <p>The inability to multi-task can be a huge hindrance to the sales team as a whole because it slows down the process for everyone. Where one person is not picking up the slack, someone else is having to put in extra work to make sure the whole team stays on track.</p>\n  <div>\n   <h4 class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">7. PERSISTENT</span></h4>\n   <p class=\"flex-video\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Every team is going to meet its fair share of obstacles. Facing objections and failures can be really difficult, but it shouldn&rsquo;t stop your team from moving forward. Persistence, in the face of challenges is imperative; one of the definitive top sales skills needed for a sales team to thrive. Persistence is not just important in the face of adversity either; if every sales call immediately resulted in a sale the job would be a lot easier. The reality is that being persistent is the key to making sales all around.</span></p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>",

      "summary": "<p>The Art of Sales conference came to Toronto on December 7, 2016 featuring seven incredible thought leaders. Here are the key takeaways from Charles Duhigg's talk.</p>",
      "description": "<h4>1. Train Yourself to Think Differently</h4>\n<p>Instead of trying to multitask all the time like everyone else, try establishing a contemplative routine. Thinking more deeply about your goals and priorities allows you to zone in and act more effectively. Challenge the mental models in your head and look for the alternatives.</p>\n<h4>2. Be Situationally Aware</h4>\n<p>If you can form a story that helps you with the situation at hand, you'll be better off in the end. When we have too much stimulus around us, we only look at the most obvious. It's not necessary to react after every single prompt and alarm.</p>\n<h4>3. Innovation can be Juxtaposition</h4>\n<p>Some of the best ideas have come from taking something familiar and mixing it with the unfamiliar. The best kind of creativity doesn't come from sitting in a room waiting for an idea to appear. Instead, it comes from the people who can figure out who to take existing ideas from on eplace and insert them in to a new setting</p>\n<h4>4. Psychological Safety Motivates Us</h4>\n<p>There's no surefire explanation as to why some teams are more successful than others.

Thinking more deeply about your goals and priorities allows you to zone in and act more effectively. Challenge the mental models in your head and look for the alternatives.</p>\n<h4>2. Be Situationally Aware</h4>\n<p>If you can form a story that helps you with the situation at hand, you'll be better off in the end. When we have too much stimulus around us, we only look at the most obvious. It's not necessary to react after every single prompt and alarm.</p>\n<h4>3. Innovation can be Juxtaposition</h4>\n<p>Some of the best ideas have come from taking something familiar and mixing it with the unfamiliar. The best kind of creativity doesn't come from sitting in a room waiting for an idea to appear. Instead, it comes from the people who can figure out who to take existing ideas from on eplace and insert them in to a new setting</p>\n<h4>4. Psychological Safety Motivates Us</h4>\n<p>There's no surefire explanation as to why some teams are more successful than others. However, feeling secure in taking risks is a big factor in helping teams perform.When we feel like we're in control of the environment, we act with more confidence and yeld better results.</p>"

      "summary": "<p>Your sales pitch is ready. You know all the answers to any possible question. You've even found the decision-maker, who holds all deciding power. What now? How do you speak to them? How do you know they indeed hold the power?</p>",
      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Finding the real decision maker may be one of the largest barriers to a sale in existence. It&rsquo;s second to one other barrier: &ldquo;Once I find the decision maker, what do I say?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Finding the decision maker and speaking with that decision maker intelligently are not just critical, they&rsquo;re also skills that can be career building or career ending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">I&rsquo;m about to give you insight that will help you find and communicate with the all-important decider. But I caution you, it is not a be-all end-all. Rather, it&rsquo;s the beginning of your true understanding about decision makers, and decision making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">There are several parts to the decision-making process. Finding the decision maker is only one of them and it may be the smallest one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Early in my career, I created a question that helped me find decision makers without ever asking anyone who the decision maker was. Whoever I was talking to, as I was making the sales presentation, I asked the question, &ldquo;Who pulls the trigger?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">That was a direct question that didn&rsquo;t insult the person I was talking to. If you ask, &ldquo;Are you the decision-maker?&rdquo; or worse, &ldquo;Who is the decision-maker?&rdquo; you both embarrass the prospect, and pressure them for an answer. To the person you&rsquo;re talking to it gives the impression you&rsquo;re sales hungry instead of customer friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">By asking, &ldquo;Who pulls the trigger?&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings. You&rsquo;re merely asking for distant information. Vital, but distant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">After I asked the &ldquo;who pulls the trigger&rdquo; question, I followed up with an equally powerful, but still pressure-less question. I simply asked, &ldquo;How will the decision be made?&rdquo; And whatever my prospective customer said, I followed up with yet another question about the decision-making process, &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The words &ldquo;then what&rdquo; lead you through the decision-making process. Especially if you continue to ask it. Then what? Then what? Then what? Until finally you come back to the trigger puller. It sounds pretty easy, doesn&rsquo;t it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Well, over the years I found that it wasn&rsquo;t quite that easy. I had to have a greater understanding of the total process especially what happened after the purchase was completed. In other words, what happens after ownership and what are the expected outcomes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">You may think what happens after ownership and expected outcomes have little or nothing to do with the decision maker. And you would be totally, completely incorrect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">After ownership comes value of purchase. Often erroneously referred to as ROI, it&rsquo;s what happens after the customer takes possession, and what they&rsquo;re hoping to achieve as a result of it. REALITY: That&rsquo;s the only thing decision makers want to know. And once you know it, you&rsquo;ll be able to find every decision maker. That&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">There are additional questions you MUST ask during a sales meeting in order to find out the total purchasing and use of product or service situation. Keep in mind, you&rsquo;re going to be selling for about an hour, but they&rsquo;re going to be using your product or service for years. Once you understand that, you understand the significance of obtaining that information.</span></p>\n<div>\n Here are the critical decision-making questions: \n <p>&bull; Who do you collaborate with?<br />\n &bull; Who will be the main user of&hellip;?<br />\n &bull; Who calls and asks for service?<br />\n &bull; When a service person arrives, who do they meet with?<br />\n &bull; How did the last purchase happen?<br />\n &bull; Who will be responsible for the outcome of this purchase?</p>\n <p>HERE&rsquo;S THE SECRET:</p>\n <p>Once you have the names of these people, you ask the person you&rsquo;re meeting with to introduce you. And talk to these people about what really happens. Even if you&rsquo;re meeting with the CEO, you can still ask for meetings with his or her people.</p>\n <p>Once you have this information and meet the people involved&hellip;</p>\n <p>Look at the insight you&rsquo;ve gained.</p>\n <p>Look at the understanding you have about their business process.</p>\n <p>Look at the expertise you put into your experience base.</p>\n <p>And even more important, you&rsquo;re now charged with the responsibility of making certain every person involved in use and decision making are aware of your value.</p>\n <p>&ldquo;Jeffrey,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pretty complicated process. In fact, it changes my whole strategy of selling.&rdquo;</p>\n <p>That&rsquo;s correct, your way was a fight to get to the decision maker. People lied to you, and people led you down a rosy path that completely wasted your time. Oh, and you lost the order. My way is a little bit more difficult to learn and implement, but a heck of a lot more productive in terms of not just finding the decision maker, but actually making the sale &ndash; and gaining experience and expertise for the next sale.</p>\n <p>Now you have to make a decision. Decide to try it my way!</p>\n</div>",

          "textOnly": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Finding the real decision maker may be one of the largest barriers to a sale in existence. It&rsquo;s second to one other barrier: &ldquo;Once I find the decision maker, what do I say?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Finding the decision maker and speaking with that decision maker intelligently are not just critical, they&rsquo;re also skills that can be career building or career ending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">I&rsquo;m about to give you insight that will help you find and communicate with the all-important decider. But I caution you, it is not a be-all end-all. Rather, it&rsquo;s the beginning of your true understanding about decision makers, and decision making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">There are several parts to the decision-making process. Finding the decision maker is only one of them and it may be the smallest one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Early in my career, I created a question that helped me find decision makers without ever asking anyone who the decision maker was. Whoever I was talking to, as I was making the sales presentation, I asked the question, &ldquo;Who pulls the trigger?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">That was a direct question that didn&rsquo;t insult the person I was talking to. If you ask, &ldquo;Are you the decision-maker?&rdquo; or worse, &ldquo;Who is the decision-maker?&rdquo; you both embarrass the prospect, and pressure them for an answer. To the person you&rsquo;re talking to it gives the impression you&rsquo;re sales hungry instead of customer friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">By asking, &ldquo;Who pulls the trigger?&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings. You&rsquo;re merely asking for distant information. Vital, but distant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">After I asked the &ldquo;who pulls the trigger&rdquo; question, I followed up with an equally powerful, but still pressure-less question. I simply asked, &ldquo;How will the decision be made?&rdquo; And whatever my prospective customer said, I followed up with yet another question about the decision-making process, &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The words &ldquo;then what&rdquo; lead you through the decision-making process. Especially if you continue to ask it. Then what? Then what? Then what? Until finally you come back to the trigger puller. It sounds pretty easy, doesn&rsquo;t it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Well, over the years I found that it wasn&rsquo;t quite that easy. I had to have a greater understanding of the total process especially what happened after the purchase was completed. In other words, what happens after ownership and what are the expected outcomes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">You may think what happens after ownership and expected outcomes have little or nothing to do with the decision maker. And you would be totally, completely incorrect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">After ownership comes value of purchase. Often erroneously referred to as ROI, it&rsquo;s what happens after the customer takes possession, and what they&rsquo;re hoping to achieve as a result of it. REALITY: That&rsquo;s the only thing decision makers want to know. And once you know it, you&rsquo;ll be able to find every decision maker. That&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">There are additional questions you MUST ask during a sales meeting in order to find out the total purchasing and use of product or service situation. Keep in mind, you&rsquo;re going to be selling for about an hour, but they&rsquo;re going to be using your product or service for years. Once you understand that, you understand the significance of obtaining that information.</span></p>\n<div>\n Here are the critical decision-making questions: \n <p>&bull; Who do you collaborate with?<br />\n &bull; Who will be the main user of&hellip;?<br />\n &bull; Who calls and asks for service?<br />\n &bull; When a service person arrives, who do they meet with?<br />\n &bull; How did the last purchase happen?<br />\n &bull; Who will be responsible for the outcome of this purchase?</p>\n <p>HERE&rsquo;S THE SECRET:</p>\n <p>Once you have the names of these people, you ask the person you&rsquo;re meeting with to introduce you. And talk to these people about what really happens. Even if you&rsquo;re meeting with the CEO, you can still ask for meetings with his or her people.</p>\n <p>Once you have this information and meet the people involved&hellip;</p>\n <p>Look at the insight you&rsquo;ve gained.</p>\n <p>Look at the understanding you have about their business process.</p>\n <p>Look at the expertise you put into your experience base.</p>\n <p>And even more important, you&rsquo;re now charged with the responsibility of making certain every person involved in use and decision making are aware of your value.</p>\n <p>&ldquo;Jeffrey,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pretty complicated process. In fact, it changes my whole strategy of selling.&rdquo;</p>\n <p>That&rsquo;s correct, your way was a fight to get to the decision maker. People lied to you, and people led you down a rosy path that completely wasted your time. Oh, and you lost the order. My way is a little bit more difficult to learn and implement, but a heck of a lot more productive in terms of not just finding the decision maker, but actually making the sale &ndash; and gaining experience and expertise for the next sale.</p>\n <p>Now you have to make a decision. Decide to try it my way!</p>\n</div>"

Whether trying to nail that big interview, convince a client, or get the neighbor to finally trim their hedges, most people would love to be a bit more persuasive. So how do we do that?</p>\n<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re stuck in the throes of a tense housing negotiation. You&rsquo;ve been searching for months and you finally found a place you like. It&rsquo;s got a great yard, more than enough space, and a nice open layout that fits your life perfectly. The only challenge is the seller. They&rsquo;re asking way more than you think the house is worth. You offered a number you thought was fair, they countered with a different amount, and even after a few rounds of back and forth, you&rsquo;re still far from reaching a deal.</p>\n<p>Trust is a key part of any negotiation. Sure, there are specific numbers each side is trying to reach, but rather than fighting over their slice, good negotiators know how to increase the size of the pie. Not just focusing on price, but finding other dimensions where value can be created. Maybe the seller could use an earlier closing date, or needs to get rid of their furniture because they&rsquo;re moving out of the country. Getting the other side to trust you enough to reveal private information often enables a better outcome to be reached.</p>\n<p>But trust is the last thing most people feel in a one-off negotiation. Each side is consumed with extracting the value from the other: how to give up the least information so they can keep the most value for themselves.</p>\n<p>So how can people build trust more effectively? Win the other side over and get them to disclose information they might otherwise want to keep to themselves?</p>\n<p>Scientists studying successful negotiations found that a simple trick made negotiators five times more successful. Five times more likely to close the deal, even when all seemed lost.</p>\n<p>That trick? Mimicking one&rsquo;s negotiating partner.</p>\n<p>If one person rested their chin on their hand, the other did the same. If one person leaned back or forward on their chair, the other imitated that movement. Not blatantly, but discreetly enough that the other person wouldn&rsquo;t notice.</p>\n<p>This might seem silly. After all, why should someone rubbing their face or leaning back in their chair change whether people reach a deal? But it did. People who mimicked their partner&rsquo;s mannerisms were five times as likely to find a successful outcome.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just negotiators. Imagine you&rsquo;re out to lunch one sunny day with a couple of colleagues from work. You&rsquo;re sitting outside a local restaurant, and after scanning the menu for a few minutes you know exactly what you&rsquo;re going to get. The waiter asks you what you&rsquo;d like, and the order rolls off your tongue: The Cobb Salad, extra chicken, with dressing on the side. Okay, he says, The Cobb Salad, extra chicken, with dressing on the side, correct? Yes, you reply, excitedly. You can already hear your stomach rumbling.</p>\n<p>Notice what happened? Probably not.</p>\n<p>Yet the same thing happens to each of us dozens of times a day. The waiter didn&rsquo;t just take your order, he mimicked you. He could have just said ok or coming right up! But he didn&rsquo;t. He repeated your order back to you, word-for-word, saying the exact thing you said.</p>\n<p>Seem trivial? Maybe. But research shows that this mimicry just increased the waiter&rsquo;s tip by 70 percent. Mimicry has all sorts of beneficial consequences. Daters whose linguistic styles better matched one another were three times more likely to want to see each other again. Existing couples with similar linguistics styles were 50 percent more likely to still be dating three months later.</p>\n<p>Such imitation also boosts professional success. In interviews, mimicry made interviewees feel more comfortable and perform better. In negotiations, mimicry not only helped people reach deals, it enabled negotiators to create value and claim more of that value for themselves. And in sales contexts, mimicry increased persuasion. Mimicry facilitates social interactions because it generates rapport. Like a social glue, mimicry binds and bonds people together. Part of this may be driven by the association between similarity and kinship. Just like finding out a work colleague grew up in the same small town thousands of miles away, when someone has the same accent, loves the same indie brand, or also says &ldquo;ya&rsquo;ll&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;you,&rdquo; we feel an affinity or bond.</p>\n<p>Consequently, when we imitate someone, or behave similarly, that person starts to infer that we have things in common or are part of the same tribe. Seeing someone speaking, or acting the same way can serve as a nonconscious signal that we are connected. These connections, in turn, boost liking and smooth interaction. Rather than seeing someone as a competitor, or a stranger, mimicry makes people feel more interconnected. Closer and more interdependent. All without even realizing it. Interviewing for a job, starting a tough negotiation, or just trying to turn a first date into a second one? Imitating the language, behavior, or facial expressions of others can increase success. Mimicry increases liking, trust, and affiliation. So don&rsquo;t just listen; emulate. If an interviewer leans back on their chair and crosses their legs, do the same. If a client starts emails with &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; adopt that language. Subtle shifts can deepen social bonds, turn strangers to friends, and make acquaintances into allies.</p>",

Okay, he says, The Cobb Salad, extra chicken, with dressing on the side, correct? Yes, you reply, excitedly. You can already hear your stomach rumbling.</p>\n<p>Notice what happened? Probably not.</p>\n<p>Yet the same thing happens to each of us dozens of times a day. The waiter didn&rsquo;t just take your order, he mimicked you. He could have just said ok or coming right up! But he didn&rsquo;t. He repeated your order back to you, word-for-word, saying the exact thing you said.</p>\n<p>Seem trivial? Maybe. But research shows that this mimicry just increased the waiter&rsquo;s tip by 70 percent. Mimicry has all sorts of beneficial consequences. Daters whose linguistic styles better matched one another were three times more likely to want to see each other again. Existing couples with similar linguistics styles were 50 percent more likely to still be dating three months later.</p>\n<p>Such imitation also boosts professional success. In interviews, mimicry made interviewees feel more comfortable and perform better. In negotiations, mimicry not only helped people reach deals, it enabled negotiators to create value and claim more of that value for themselves. And in sales contexts, mimicry increased persuasion. Mimicry facilitates social interactions because it generates rapport. Like a social glue, mimicry binds and bonds people together. Part of this may be driven by the association between similarity and kinship. Just like finding out a work colleague grew up in the same small town thousands of miles away, when someone has the same accent, loves the same indie brand, or also says &ldquo;ya&rsquo;ll&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;you,&rdquo; we feel an affinity or bond.</p>\n<p>Consequently, when we imitate someone, or behave similarly, that person starts to infer that we have things in common or are part of the same tribe. Seeing someone speaking, or acting the same way can serve as a nonconscious signal that we are connected. These connections, in turn, boost liking and smooth interaction. Rather than seeing someone as a competitor, or a stranger, mimicry makes people feel more interconnected. Closer and more interdependent. All without even realizing it. Interviewing for a job, starting a tough negotiation, or just trying to turn a first date into a second one? Imitating the language, behavior, or facial expressions of others can increase success. Mimicry increases liking, trust, and affiliation. So don&rsquo;t just listen; emulate. If an interviewer leans back on their chair and crosses their legs, do the same. If a client starts emails with &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; adopt that language. Subtle shifts can deepen social bonds, turn strangers to friends, and make acquaintances into allies.</p>"

      "description": "<p>For nearly a year with next to no luck, General Ulysses S. Grant tried to crack the defenses of Vicksburg, a city perched high on the cliffs of the Mississippi critical to the Confederacy&rsquo;s stranglehold on the most important river in the United States.

      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">This is one of Gartner&rsquo;s top 10 strategic predictions for 2017 (http://ibm.biz/gartnertop10-aom) and beyond and by far the most striking one. No doubt, this coming revolution in cognitive computing will affect all aspects of business but one area where it will revolutionize our interactions is in marketing and customer engagement. Customer expectations are at an all time high, customers expect organizations to know them and personalize each interaction based on where they are in their buying journey. At the same time, marketers are gaining more and more visibility and responsibility in the organization. Forrester reports that 82% of CMOs report their goals are aligned to revenue targets and 1 in 3 CMOs hold responsibility for business unit P&amp;L (up 13% from 2014) (Forrester &ndash; &ldquo;The Evolved CMO in 2016).</span></p>\n<div>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">So how can cognitive computing help marketers succeed in this age of evolving expectations? There are, no doubt, a multitude of ways in which cognitive technologies can help marketers. Cognitive can help you understand and analyze how interactions with your customers are breaking down or succeeding across multiple channels and screens, offer ways to derive insights from your data as well as external data such as weather and generate ways to interact naturally with customers. In fact, IDC predicts that by 2020, 50% of companieswill use cognitive computing to automate marketing and sales interactions with their customers. (IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Chief Marketing Officer Advisory 2016 Predictions). This article will showcase three specific examples in which marketers are starting to use cognitive technologies to delight their customers.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">First of all, let&rsquo;s define what we mean by cognitive. IBM Watson is a cognitive technology that can understand, reason, learn and interact in natural ways with humans. IBM Watson leverages data (including dark data such as pictures, video, emojis etc that is not easily accessible and makes up 80% of the data in the world), and partners with humans to influence, experiment and explore. There is a phrase that our head of development, Kareem Yusuf, uses in this video demo clip (http://ibm.biz/youtubewatson-aom) that I love: Watson is a &ldquo;learned colleague&rdquo; that can help you make better decisions faster and at scale. IBM Watson illuminate new possibilities for your business.</span></p>\n <p>Let&rsquo;s see then, examples from some of our clients who are using IBM Watson currently to innovate the way they are engaging their customers:</p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">On the e-commerce side, Staples brought their famous &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; button (http://ibm.biz/ easybutton-aom) to life with the help of IBM Watson. You can now press the Easy button on&nbsp;your desk and order something from the Staples store in real time. Even if you don&rsquo;t have an Easy button, you can use the system from your mobile device, Slack channel or Facebook. You can sign up to learn more about the Staples Easy System and test it for yourself here: http://ibm.biz/ easysystem-aom</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">In addition to simplifying some of the most common tasks associated with maintaining an office, bringing in cognitive capabilities to&nbsp;help your users in re-ordering and tracking shipments can help your business learn more about their business preferences and needs. Over time you can develop a closer relationship with your customers as you start to understand and anticipate their needs.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">IBM Watson is helping companies transform how customers are interacting with their brand across all properties &ndash; online and offline. The North Face built this cognitive application with business partner Fluid and Watson analytics. On the North Face&rsquo;s site, you can interact by typing or speech with Watson. You answer a few questions about your travel plans and apparel needs to receive the appropriate personalized outwear recommendations. Contrast this with the multiple checkbox filtering process we have to endure on most shopping sites today. The pilot generated a 60% click through rate to the product recommendation. 1-800-Flowers also recently implemented this with GWYN &ndash; Gifts when you need them. Also Macy&rsquo;s is working on a store assistant with Watson where you can ask a question on your phone in the Macy&rsquo;s app that is store specific and the application will guide you.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">One final example: ING Direct Australia (http://ibm.biz/ingdirau-aom) partnered with IBM to create a highly automated and personalized marketing process. Their goal was to enable real time personalization at scale. ING used IBM Interact real time offer engine to ingest many types of data and then apply performance results and predictive models to automatically learn and improve offer selection over time. With this solution ING DIRECT Australia created an automated system that executes more than 100 contextual triggers per day to share relevant, personalized messages to over one million customers each month.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">If you are interested in trying out how cognitive could apply to marketing, here are a couple of ways you can get started: You can go to ibm.com/cognitive and try out specific APIs. For example, Personality Insights will take in your text or your twitter ID and based on the input, will analyze your personality across five dimensions. Or for a limited time, you can try cognitive as applied to content &ndash; Watson can analyze your images and content and tag them appropriately: http://ibm.biz/watsonhub-aom</span></p>\n <div>\n  &nbsp;\n </div>\n</div>",

You can sign up to learn more about the Staples Easy System and test it for yourself here: http://ibm.biz/ easysystem-aom</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">In addition to simplifying some of the most common tasks associated with maintaining an office, bringing in cognitive capabilities to&nbsp;help your users in re-ordering and tracking shipments can help your business learn more about their business preferences and needs. Over time you can develop a closer relationship with your customers as you start to understand and anticipate their needs.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">IBM Watson is helping companies transform how customers are interacting with their brand across all properties &ndash; online and offline. The North Face built this cognitive application with business partner Fluid and Watson analytics. On the North Face&rsquo;s site, you can interact by typing or speech with Watson. You answer a few questions about your travel plans and apparel needs to receive the appropriate personalized outwear recommendations. Contrast this with the multiple checkbox filtering process we have to endure on most shopping sites today. The pilot generated a 60% click through rate to the product recommendation. 1-800-Flowers also recently implemented this with GWYN &ndash; Gifts when you need them. Also Macy&rsquo;s is working on a store assistant with Watson where you can ask a question on your phone in the Macy&rsquo;s app that is store specific and the application will guide you.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">One final example: ING Direct Australia (http://ibm.biz/ingdirau-aom) partnered with IBM to create a highly automated and personalized marketing process. Their goal was to enable real time personalization at scale. ING used IBM Interact real time offer engine to ingest many types of data and then apply performance results and predictive models to automatically learn and improve offer selection over time. With this solution ING DIRECT Australia created an automated system that executes more than 100 contextual triggers per day to share relevant, personalized messages to over one million customers each month.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">If you are interested in trying out how cognitive could apply to marketing, here are a couple of ways you can get started: You can go to ibm.com/cognitive and try out specific APIs. For example, Personality Insights will take in your text or your twitter ID and based on the input, will analyze your personality across five dimensions. Or for a limited time, you can try cognitive as applied to content &ndash; Watson can analyze your images and content and tag them appropriately: http://ibm.biz/watsonhub-aom</span></p>\n <div>\n  &nbsp;\n </div>\n</div>"

      "description": "<p><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re that social media guy, right?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>I get that. The branding guy. The marketing guy. The tech guy. The media guy. The writer guy. The business book guy. The speaking guy. Depending on how people interface with me (and my content), my branding may vary. I may not love all of those titles, but it&rsquo;s a great insight into both how the world sees me (thanks for that, Sally Hogshead) and how they connect with the work that I do. With that, when asked what I do, it&rsquo;s easy to say that I &ldquo;run a digital marketing agency called Mirum.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easy to tell people that I am a writer, or a speaker on stage for The Art Of. For me, it can be situational, and I&rsquo;m not all that fussy about it, because it&rsquo;s all accurate. Many brands are focused on the one thing (and that can be important for an organization to find its differentiation). Of course, it is important to figure out the one thing that you do better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>That one thing is actually created by figuring out how many things intersect.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my simple and fast process that I use to figure out what a true center of excellence is for content. Why do this? Focus. I want to ensure that whatever messaging that I produce, publish and promote ties back (as closely as possible) to my center of excellence.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:24px;\">Use this quick 7-step methodology to build your own center of excellence:</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Step #1: The Tactic.</strong></h4>\n<p>My tactic of primary output is content. Yours might be advertising, word of mouth referrals, networking, database marketing, etc... You don&rsquo;t have to stick with just one. Obviously, I deploy all tactics to grow the brand. Choosing a primary tactic gives focus. Content works for me, personally, because of my background in writing, journalism, media and communications.</p>\n<h4>Step #2: The Format.&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>My format is text and audio. You can choose just one. And, truthfully, my &ldquo;one&rdquo; would be text, but I do find myself producing more and more audio content. We live in a world where anyone can have an idea and share it - in text, images, audio and video - and distribute it - for free - to the world. This can be long-form, short-form, live/streaming or produced. This can be highly-produced or more off the cuff. My format of choice is long-form text (articles, business books, etc...) and long-form audio (a weekly podcast called, Six Pixels of Separation &ndash; The Mirum Podcast).</p>\n<h4>Step #3: The Frequency.&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>My frequency is daily for text and weekly for audio. I don&rsquo;t recommend such a frenetic pace, but I do recommend setting up a regular schedule, and doing everything in your power to stick with it. This is often the most highlyoverlooked and mistreated part of the process. When brands fail at content, it&rsquo;s usually because they have not figured out a groove and flow, and consumers don&rsquo;t make the connection. Prior to the Internet, I was a much more voracious consumer of print magazines (had to be, there wasn&rsquo;t the selection that we have today online). I would often go to the corner store, and I could &ldquo;feel&rdquo; when the latest issue of Fast Company was due. It just &ldquo;felt&rdquo; like it had been about four weeks since the last issue. I often get feedback when the Six Pixels of Separation Podcast is published later in the day on Sunday. My listeners know that it&rsquo;s published early Sunday morning. When it&rsquo;s not there, they feel the gap and this weakens the brand. Frequency will not only keep you on schedule, it will be core to the brand experience.</p>\n<h4>Step #4: The Triangle of Attention.&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Visualize (or, better yet, draw) a triangle. For every point on the triangle choose one area of interest. My three areas of attention are: 1. Brands. 2. Consumers. 3. Technology. What does this mean? I will not produce, share or promote any content that doesn&rsquo;t (in some way) speak to all (or some) of these areas of attention. It can be only one area (even an idea that is loosely related to just one area), but the more points of the triangle that your content taps into, the more focused it will be. Choosing those three words is not as easy as it looks. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to get started on this exercise, please get the book Accidental Genius by Mark Levy. It&rsquo;s about freewriting and list-making and it will help you generate ideas much faster. I promise you, within a few minutes of studying his simple process, you will be rock and rolling.</p>\n<h4>Step #6: : The Promoter.</h4>\n<p>How do you get your message to spread? Thankfully, I&rsquo;ve been able to build (over 15 years) a significant audience. With that, I&rsquo;ve had the fortune of being a two-time published business book author, an indemand public speaker, I have a regular radio stint and write for several other publications (print and online). In short, I have many outlets and opportunities to promote my thinking. How will you get your message to catch on? What paid and organic media opportunities will you take advantage of? Many well-respected content producers tell me that they spend five hours of promoting their content for every hour of content that they produce. &ldquo;Build it and they will come,&rdquo; is not a promotion strategy. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be a broad list of opportunities. Be very specific and go after it.</p>\n<h4>Step #7: The Analysis And Adjustment Bureau&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Use your analytics (most packages are free) to better understand what is working, where it&rsquo;s working and how it is working. Think about how often you will use these tools, to not only better understand your audience, but to then adjust and tweak your content to make it connect in a more effective way.</p>",

Isn&rsquo;t 2017 the year of video? Aren&rsquo;t 360 video and live video the new frontiers? Isn&rsquo;t writing as a marketing skill hopelessly old-school?</p>\n<p>Nope. Embracing video doesn&rsquo;t mean we ignore text and writing. Quite the opposite: Writing is the foundation of a good story.

      "description": "<p>The IT guy thinks you don&rsquo;t like him. The marketing director complains that the sales director doesn&rsquo;t return her emails. Someone anonymously posts a snide note in the office kitchen about fridge etiquette.</p>\n<p>Nobody likes workplace drama. It kills morale, divides the team, and ultimately drains time and profits. As many a manager knows too well, trying to brush it away or ignore it seldom works. And as many a theatre director knows, drama&mdash;interpersonal tensions, frustrations, ill will&mdash;can be harnessed and channeled into more productive uses. Here&rsquo;s how to do it, starting with your next meeting.</p>\n<h4>What's Behind The Drama</h4>\n<p>Indeed, the desire to act out stories, improvise, and play characters and imitate others is as old as humanity itself&mdash;look no further than ancient Greece. Actually, look no further than your own childhood. For kids everywhere, play is improvisational, creative, and fundamentally performative. But for the most part, we stop playing when we grow up.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s our loss. Scholarly research and the popular press extol the benefits of play&mdash;for creativity, communication, team building, and simple stress relief, among other reasons.</p>\n<p>Over the past couple of decades, business schools, leaders, and teams have begun tapping back into the power of performance in the workplace. It may sound juvenile or even like a distraction from &ldquo;real&rdquo; work, but the truth is that we can create positive drama to help counteract the negative kind that tends to build up in most work cultures.</p>\n<p>We can free people to make new and better choices in how they work and interact. After all, companies are already used to reviewing their employees&rsquo; &ldquo;performance.&rdquo; So why not actually direct it?</p>\n<p><strong>Try This At Your Next Team Meeting</strong></p>\n<p>Are your meetings contentious, disagreement-filled, or derailed by personality conflicts? Or are they lacking in drama&mdash;boring, tedious, and not nearly as productive as they could be considering how long they run?</p>\n<p>In either case, here&rsquo;s a way to use drama to turn that meeting around and make it great (and yes, it will feel weird at first&mdash;most creativity in the workplace does at first): Tell your team that instead of just having the meeting you want to hold a performance of it. Start small&mdash;it&rsquo;s just an experiment&mdash;with a quick, 15-minute meeting &ldquo;scene,&rdquo; with half the team &ldquo;onstage&rdquo; and half as an audience.</p>\n<p>Then switch, and have the audience perform their own meeting scene. At first, you may not notice a huge difference&mdash; but that&rsquo;s okay. These performances will look and sound a lot like your ordinary meetings, but with a few differences:</p>\n<p><em>1. There&rsquo;s a director.</em></p>\n<p>In a performance, the director (that&rsquo;s you, by the way) runs the meeting like it&rsquo;s a show or rehearsal for a show. It&rsquo;s your job to call &ldquo;action!,&rdquo; &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; &ldquo;take two,&rdquo; and so on. When you encounter the usual array of personalities and communication styles&mdash;the talker who hijacks the meeting with lengthy digressions, the silent one who only speaks when spoken to, the &ldquo;smartest person in the room,&rdquo; the one who&rsquo;s overly amenable to everything, the bureaucrat who enforces all the rules, the perpetually confused one, the time-sucking philosopher&mdash; you can do much more than simply be annoyed, frustrated, or complacent. Because it&rsquo;s a performance, these are now &ldquo;characters,&rdquo; and as such you can direct their performances.</p>\n<p><em>2. The performance is visible.</em></p>\n<p>The immediate effect of performing a meeting is that everyone becomes aware of their performance. The meeting is no longer simply happening, and team members aren&rsquo;t just passively in it. Now they&rsquo;re both in it and can see how it&rsquo;s going, what you&rsquo;re doing, and what others are doing. The experience takes on a kind of &ldquo;meta&rdquo; dimension that doesn&rsquo;t do away with the usual drama, tensions, and irritations, but makes them simultaneously more apparent and less threatening.</p>\n<p><em>3. The performance is changeable.</em></p>\n<p>And now, with the awareness that this is a performance, we can make different choices about how to perform. That includes not just what you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re saying it, how it&rsquo;s being heard, and how others are responding as a result. You, as the director, can now help people try different performance choices in their character, their actions, and their dialogue.</p>\n<p><em>4. It&rsquo;s team-building, too.</em></p>\n<p>And now, with the awareness that this is a performance, we can make different choices about how to perform. That includes not just what you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re saying it, how it&rsquo;s being heard, and how others are responding as a result. You, as the director, can now help people try different performance choices in their character, their actions, and their dialogue.</p>\n<h4>GET OUT OF THE DIRECTOR&rsquo;S CHAIR</h4>\n<p>Once the team has gotten the hang of this and you&rsquo;ve performed/directed your way through a full meeting or two, mix it up a bit. Have each person take on the role or character that someone else has been playing.</p>\n<p>That could simply mean swapping characters&mdash;the silent one plays the naysayer, and vice versa. Or it could be playing a character that you want in the meeting&mdash;like somebody who always supports other people&rsquo;s ideas, or who&rsquo;s genuinely curious and asks helpful questions.</p>\n<p>Making your staff meeting (and other conversations at work) a performance can help defuse workplace drama and teach you and your colleagues to take a break from your usual, unacknowledged &ldquo;characters&rdquo; and &ldquo;scripts.&rdquo; It builds our awareness of our working selves as performers, of the team as a performing ensemble, and of the fact that we&rsquo;re always performing to one degree or another, wherever we go.</p>\n<p>Best of all, this simple technique can free us to create new performances&mdash;new versions of ourselves&mdash;anytime we want. That level of versatility, agility, and adaptability is something any manager would be grateful for, and it can&rsquo;t be faked. It can, however, be performed.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Like it or not, businesses are drifting away from the consumer. Recently, as I jumped on-stage at a gathering of executives in New York City, I asked how many had spent time in a consumer&rsquo;s home over the past year. Out of 3,000 executives in the audience, only two raised their hands. The unspoken reply could just as well have been: &ldquo;Why should I? All I have to do is turn on my computer, and I&rsquo;ll find never-ending streams of tables modeling how consumers feel about my brand.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But isn&rsquo;t this the same as describing the love of your life by the numbers? I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t reply that you love your girlfriend because she&rsquo;s 6 feet 7 tall, her hair color is Pantone 39134, and the last four digits of her cell phone number turn you on?</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve come to rely on BIG Data to understand the emotions of our most important asset&mdash;our customers&mdash;but cracks have begun to appear in the BIG Data varnish. Businesses are starting to realize that BIG Data has the potential to overlook some of the most important aspects of their customers&rsquo; desires and needs.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, one of the major U.S. banking institutions misinterpreted an increase of &ldquo;churn.&rdquo; This term refers to customers who begin to move their money around, refinance their mortgages, and show other signs that they may be on the verge of exiting the bank. As a consequence, the bank began preparing letters asking its customers to reconsider moving on. Before mailing the letters, though, the bank executives discovered something surprising. Yes, indeed, BIG Data had uncovered evidence of churning, but BIG Data didn&rsquo;t see into the bank&rsquo;s customers&rsquo; lives, and so it couldn&rsquo;t explain the cause. The churn wasn&rsquo;t because customers were dissatisfied with the bank. The real reason? These customers were getting divorces, which explained why they were shifting around their assets.</p>\n<p>The bank had relied on correlations generated by BIG Data, but an essential piece of the puzzle was missing. They had missed the counterbalance to Big Data. They&rsquo;d seen the correlations, but they&rsquo;d overlooked causation. This is what I call Small Data.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the LEGO company was close to bankruptcy. For years, the iconic toy company had been anxious about a decline in sales. The younger generation had simply moved on, preferring digital play to plastic blocks. LEGO&rsquo;s young customers were leaving the LEGO universe far behind.</p>\n<p>BIG Data had one lesson for LEGO: The instantgratification generation had arrived, and kids of the future would no longer make time for longwinded physical play. In 2003, as a consequence of the BIG Data learnings, LEGO made a dramatic move. They decided to change the size of their tiny LEGO bricks to gigantic building blocks. Where the construction of a LEGO castle in the past would have taken days, now the journey was reduced to hours, if not minutes.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the move had the exact opposite effect. By Christmas 2003, LEGO was stunned to realize a $240 million operating loss on sales of $1 billion and was sitting on some $747million in debts, leaving the entire company in jeopardy.</p>\n<p>It was then, in the nick of time, that a team from LEGO decided to visit consumers in their homes across Europe. While visiting a home in Germany, LEGO asked an 11-year-old boy what he was proudest of; he pointed out an old pair of raggedy, worndown sneakers that he kept displayed on a shelf. He explained that the sneakers were proof that he was the best skater in town. The wear on the side of the sneaker demonstrated to his friends that he was capable of sliding down his skateboard at a perfect angle. The shoes had become his trophy.</p>\n<p>The story was surprising, to say the least, as that seemingly insignificant consumer observation &mdash; this piece of Small Data, in contrast to the corporate researchers&rsquo; Big Data &mdash; clearly showed that if kids are placed in the driver&rsquo;s seat, time is no longer the most essential element. Given the right motivation, they are still willing to devote hundreds of hours to perfecting a skateboard trick or building a fantastic castle. LEGO returned to their traditional tiny bricks and dramatically increased the number of bricks in each box. And, they laid the foundation for the LEGO movie. These helped infuse renewed passion into kids&rsquo; play patterns. LEGO quickly recovered, and today, 10 years later, LEGO is the largest toy manufacturer in the world.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not an opponent of BIG Data. I am, however, a huge believer in achieving the right balance between correlation and causation. No matter how intelligent the analysts and data miners are, sitting in their airconditioned offices, the hypotheses they test against enormous masses of data points are still just that &mdash; abstract hypotheses.</p>\n<p>In Small Data, however, now and forever, lies the clearest evidence of who we are and what we desire &mdash; even if, as those LEGO executives discovered more than a decade ago, it&rsquo;s a pair of old Adidas sneakers with worn-down heels.</p>",

A new school of study called Positive Psychology delves deep into how positivity impacts human health, strengthens the body, and effects the workplace.</p>",
      "description": "<p class=\"lead\">What is it about us humans that makes us so drawn to the negative? Every mistake we make seems to stick in out brains like Velcro, while our successes slide out like they're on Teflon.</p>\n<p>For decades, psychologists have studied the effect of the negative in our lives&mdash;trauma, addiction, stress, and so on. But there&rsquo;s a relatively new school of study called Positive Psychology. Martin Seligman, PhD, brought it to light in 1998 when he was president of the American Psychological Association, but it originated with Maslow in his 1954 book Motivation and Personality. Today at Harvard, Positive Psychology 1504 is the school&rsquo;s most popular class, and Penn offers an entire master&rsquo;s degree on the subject.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder positivity is gaining in popularity: We humans can actually become healthier and happier if we teach ourselves to focus more on positive emotions such as forgiveness, compassion, altruism, and gratitude. Dr. Robert Emmons at UC Berkeley has found that people who are more grateful are happier, more outgoing, less lonely, and even have stronger immune systems and lower blood pressure.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve now surveyed more than 850,000 people for our books, and we have found that managers who express sincere and frequent gratitude for their employees&rsquo; achievements have on average significantly lower employee turnover, higher customer satisfaction, and higher worker engagement levels.</p>\n<p>In 2017, may we suggest a laser-like focus on the concept of gratitude as a key to a happier and more successful life. Below we offer 4 simple ways to get started in your team:</p>\n<h4>1. Do it Now</h4>\n<p>Gratitude doesn&rsquo;t age well. The closer recognition and appreciation follows a desired behavior, the more strongly that action is reinforced. If you want to inspire your team and show real appreciation, you will find the time. It doesn&rsquo;t take long. The best managers we&rsquo;ve studied spent on average about an hour a week recognizing their people, but the results were higher employee engagement, trust, and energy levels. After all, how much time do you need to pen a handwritten thank-you note, let the world know of someone&rsquo;s accomplishment on their social media site, or say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in a specific way in a team meeting?</p>\n<h4>2. Do it Often</h4>\n<p>Gratitude should be habitual to build a positive culture. In the best workplaces, people feel praised every seven days, according to research from the Gallup Organization. Gratitude never gets old if it is aligned with the core values of the organization or your team. Does anyone ever tire of their manager saying you matter and you add value?</p>\n<h4>3. Be Specific</h4>\n<p>Everyone in a team must clearly understand what behaviour triggered your gratitude in order to repeat it. For the best impact, clearly link each recognition event to one of your core values that you wish to see repeated. Non-specific praise is actually disheartening for an employee, since it implies that their manager has no idea of the unique value they bring to the team. Many managers who offer this type of general gratitude may think they are rewarding the entire team with comments such as, &ldquo;Thanks, everyone, for all your hard work,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You all make me proud.&rdquo; But such general gratitude has no effect, and has even been shown to have a negative impact on those in your charge.</p>\n<h4>4. Be Sincere</h4>\n<p>Reward only those behaviors you truly value, with your heartfelt and public gratitude. This is all too rare and can be extraordinarily meaningful. So gather people together. Your gratitude should be expressed publicly, your criticism in private. The team in attendance will learn as much or even more than the person being thanked.</p>\n<p>While the research shows gratitude can help any business or team, our respective families are also trying an experiment to be more grateful in our lives overall in 2017. We each have family apps where we post daily the things for which we are grateful. These can be simple things like a good meal, an interesting conversation, or a tender mercy in nature such as a beautiful sunset.</p>\n<p>Can 2017 be a year of gratitude in your team and your family? We would love to hear your stories of gratitude, and perhaps your plans.</p>",

      "description": "<p>I heard from sports scientists, nutritionists, marine biologists, other marathon swimmers, other endurance athletes, plenty of fans. The whole world had now stamped this quest impossible. Our friend from South Africa, Dr. Tim Noakes, wrote me. (Bonnie learned from Tim to feed me real food, not so many compressed goos and gels, and we found tremendous improvement over nausea with my Handlers dropping handfuls of plain cooked pasta into my mouth.

He goads him to sit back in a comfortable chair and watch as the guy in the ring gets dirty and bloody and falls and fails over and over again. Roosevelt says he&rsquo;d rather be the guy in the ring who &ldquo;spends himself in a worthy cause.&rdquo; And the quote continues: &ldquo;if he fails, at least {he} fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Bonnie hears me say I&rsquo;m not fixated on making it anymore, that what it&rsquo;s truly about now is not giving up, that the cause is that worthy to me, we have come full circle to the journey-versus-destination debate. This Swim was about my reawakening to a bold life, a calling to fill my days with acute passion, goals more noble than actually making it from Cuba to Florida. I refuse to take a place among timid souls.</p>\n<p>I also tell Bonnie I am more a consummate professional than a fool. This is not blind ambition. I wouldn&rsquo;t come at it a fifth time if I didn&rsquo;t intend to bring more to it this time. There is more jellyfish protection to innovate. There is more knowledge of those swirling eddies to fully discover. Nobody could criticize me for calling it quits after four valiant tries, but I weigh sitting at home wondering the rest of my life if I could in fact have brought new layers of expertise to the mission, as opposed to trying again, maybe not making it a fifth time, entirely at peace that I did bring better protocols to the effort. At peace that I didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>\n<p>I realize Bonnie and Candace have truly feared for my life out there. I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem remotely likely that all of nature&rsquo;s powers we&rsquo;ve met up with will cooperate at once. But I am convinced that the person gutsy enough to go out there five times has a much better chance of getting it all going her way than the ones who pack it up at the first defeat. I can see it. I can envision that other shore.</p>\n<p>Bonnie falls silent. I know better than to push her. She promises to help me through training and asks me to leave the Cuba issue alone. The cause has been worthy to her so far, and I can only hope it will rise as such to her again in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Right or wrong. I am not deterred. Perhaps I am stubborn to a fault. I just don&rsquo;t pay much attention to parameters and restrictions and limiting definitions. My particular brand of &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; mentality started young. I remember observing my outlandishly dramatic father and my lovely but meek mother, at a very young age, and deciding that I was going to carve my own unique path, devise my own rules.</p>\n<p>When Steve Jobs died, Bonnie and I watched the 60 Minutes episode dedicated to him. Somebody said, in effect, &ldquo;Steve just didn&rsquo;t think rules pertained to him. He saw himself operating under some other standards.&rdquo; His colleagues were continually flabbergasted when Jobs would demand that certain programming or new design platforms be completed on some wildly unrealistic timetable, yet they seemed to somehow produce what he envisioned, on his irrational deadlines.</p>\n<p>When Bonnie and I heard the bit about Jobs being oblivious to laws, she slowly turned toward me and stared. It&rsquo;s true. Starting with the rules laid down in my house when I was a child, I have never much respected society&rsquo;s expected standards. A woman asked me after a speech during the Cuba prep how I could train at this level, with the normal aches and pains that come at my age. I answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put your assumptions of what one is supposed to feel at my age on mine. I defy those suppositions of limitations. If you feel aches and pains, say so. But I don&rsquo;t and I refuse to follow your or anybody else&rsquo;s controlling and denigrating parameters of mediocrity.&rdquo; Anti-establishment to the quick, and not always gently so, I admit &ndash; perhaps not even sensibly so. If I come to an red light at four a.m., have stopped and looked carefully in all directions, I can&rsquo;t find the logic of sitting there for a couple of minutes, waiting for the light to turn green. I proceed. When some television executive tells me the story I&rsquo;m working on has to have a linear structure and start at the beginning, I revolt and take my case to the highest command, arguing that to embark on this particular story in the middle and work the early part in later hits the sublime emotion of it. Ask Shakespeare about in medias res. And when people from right and left and everywhere in between declared Cuba impossible, I ignored them and turned to my own analysis and instincts for the answer that rang true for me.</p>\n<p>In seeking medical counsel on my torn biceps tendon during heavy training in 2011, when I got news I couldn&rsquo;t bear, I booked another doctor, to hear a different diagnosis. And I made it, my shoulder made it, in part because I refused to buy into these particular doctors&rsquo; definitions of limitations.</p>",

I just don&rsquo;t pay much attention to parameters and restrictions and limiting definitions. My particular brand of &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; mentality started young. I remember observing my outlandishly dramatic father and my lovely but meek mother, at a very young age, and deciding that I was going to carve my own unique path, devise my own rules.</p>\n<p>When Steve Jobs died, Bonnie and I watched the 60 Minutes episode dedicated to him. Somebody said, in effect, &ldquo;Steve just didn&rsquo;t think rules pertained to him. He saw himself operating under some other standards.&rdquo; His colleagues were continually flabbergasted when Jobs would demand that certain programming or new design platforms be completed on some wildly unrealistic timetable, yet they seemed to somehow produce what he envisioned, on his irrational deadlines.</p>\n<p>When Bonnie and I heard the bit about Jobs being oblivious to laws, she slowly turned toward me and stared. It&rsquo;s true. Starting with the rules laid down in my house when I was a child, I have never much respected society&rsquo;s expected standards. A woman asked me after a speech during the Cuba prep how I could train at this level, with the normal aches and pains that come at my age. I answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put your assumptions of what one is supposed to feel at my age on mine. I defy those suppositions of limitations. If you feel aches and pains, say so. But I don&rsquo;t and I refuse to follow your or anybody else&rsquo;s controlling and denigrating parameters of mediocrity.&rdquo; Anti-establishment to the quick, and not always gently so, I admit &ndash; perhaps not even sensibly so. If I come to an red light at four a.m., have stopped and looked carefully in all directions, I can&rsquo;t find the logic of sitting there for a couple of minutes, waiting for the light to turn green. I proceed. When some television executive tells me the story I&rsquo;m working on has to have a linear structure and start at the beginning, I revolt and take my case to the highest command, arguing that to embark on this particular story in the middle and work the early part in later hits the sublime emotion of it. Ask Shakespeare about in medias res. And when people from right and left and everywhere in between declared Cuba impossible, I ignored them and turned to my own analysis and instincts for the answer that rang true for me.</p>\n<p>In seeking medical counsel on my torn biceps tendon during heavy training in 2011, when I got news I couldn&rsquo;t bear, I booked another doctor, to hear a different diagnosis. And I made it, my shoulder made it, in part because I refused to buy into these particular doctors&rsquo; definitions of limitations.</p>"

Competing in the new normal requires organizations to find talent who do things in different ways. The challenge is however, that many of these disruptors often struggle to work in the constraints of a traditional organization.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve desired results, business leaders need to make sure that they:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Find the right type of disruptors</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Engage disruptive talent in a way that aligns to their organizational commitment and readiness</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Invest sufficient energy and effort to maximize the engagement and success of disruptive talent</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Finding The Right Disruptors</h4>\n<p>Not all disruptors are created equally, and investing in the wrong type of talent can cause significant chaos and negatively impact business performance and organizational culture.</p>\n<p>Many organizations are beginning to look for people who can spot opportunities to do things differently and implement their ideas. While generating ideas and getting things done are both critical, disruptive talent who can truly have a positive impact on business results also need to have skills and competencies like self-confidence, resilience, the ability to build relationships and the flexibility required to work within the constraints of an organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Engaging Disruptors</h4>\n<p>To successfully engage this newly sought after type of talent, organizations need a strategy to define how they will engage with talent. Many leaders think that the only option is to hire disruptors, but there are a number of different ways to get started leveraging disruptors.</p>\n<p>To determine the right engagement method (i.e., whether to involve, borrow or hire), business leaders first need to take a look at two important factors:</p>\n<p><strong><em>1. Commitment to Innovation and Change</em></strong></p>\n<p>In order to maximize the return on the investment in disruptive<br />\ntalent, organizations first need to ensure that there is senior<br />\nleader commitment for innovation.

For example, they can<br />\nengage external disruptors in idea generation activities like<br />\nhackathons, or crowdsource their ideas through technology<br />\nplatforms. An organization can also consider forming an<br />\nadvisory board to help guide their evolution, borrow talent<br />\nfrom more innovative companies to work on specific projects<br />\nor consider trying a strategic interim position to test the waters.</p>\n<p><strong><em>2. Readiness for Change</em></strong></p>\n<p>Organizations must also consider their overall readiness for<br />\nthis productive type of disruption. Many organizations may<br />\nbe committed to doing things differently, but simply are not<br />\nready as a result of factors like:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Their Culture (e.g., level risk tolerance/risk management capabilities, agility, customer centricity, learning orientation, etc...)</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Innovation maturity (e.g., existence of formal strategy, process, governance, etc...)</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Technology readiness (e.g., technology investment, enterprise architecture, etc....)</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Strength of eco-system partners (e.g., relationships with innovation accelerators, technology vendors, academic institutions, etc...)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"align-right\" src=\"/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202017-05-05%20at%2010_29_32%20AM.png\" style=\"float: right; width: 550px; height: 376px;\" /></span></p>\n<h4>Maximizing The Engagement And Success Of Disruptive Talent</h4>\n<p>Once an organization finds the right disruptive talent, there is a lot of work that still needs to go in to ensuring a good return in the investment. For example, organizations should ensure that disruptor has:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Executive Sponsorship</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">A peer mentor 'informal' aspects of the organization</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Manager support to clear roadblocks</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Connection to other disruptors - to avoid feelings of not fitting in/ isolation</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Frequent feedback - often gauged against different performance criteria</span></li>\n <li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Professional coaching - especially early to ensure successful transition</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>Finding and engaging talent who can productively disrupt current thinking can be extremely effective and deliver significant business value to an organization. As with everything in business it starts with having a strategy to find the right people, engage them in the right way and ensure that they have the support required to succeed.

That training, however, didn&rsquo;t happen during his courses at medical school or during his many long shifts of residency. No, it&rsquo;s not anything that hours of watching Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy might lead you to suspect. What Dr. Semple is especially happy to have in his medical tool belt are his years of painting, sculpting and drawing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Long before Dr. Semple headed to medical school, he attended the Ontario College of Art (known today as OCAD University). After three years there, he completed an undergraduate degree in medical illustration at the University of Toronto. It&rsquo;s those years as an artist that he finds of so much value in his present work as a doctor, researcher and medical administrator. Staring at a blank canvas (which is what all artists do either literally or metaphorically when they set out to create their work) trained Dr. Semple&rsquo;s mind in a way no amount of textbook study or operating room drama could. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way you think as an artist that&rsquo;s so important,&rdquo; Dr. Semple told the Globe and Mail in a June 2012 profile. &ldquo;Thinking as an artist means connecting the dots that aren&rsquo;t next to each other&hellip; From a research point of view, that can mean looking at things in ways people haven&rsquo;t looked at before.&rdquo; He credits this mental flexibility with helping him make breakthroughs in his research on the effects of hypoxia on high-altitude mountain climbers and with allowing him to develop a mobile health project that lets patients use a smartphone app to reduce hospital visits after surgery. As he told us when we talked with him about his work, &ldquo;People tend to be so siloed; we tend to focus on only one thing. But I think it&rsquo;s the overlap areas, the areas between those silos that is so interesting. Creativity lives in those areas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Recently there has been a spate of articles, books and reports about artists or people with degrees in the liberal arts who are doing other things for a living. Or put another way, articles about highly successful people in the worlds of business, technology and health who have training in the arts and the humanities. Forbes magazine published a much reposted article entitled &ldquo;That &lsquo;Useless&rsquo; Arts Degree Has Become Tech&rsquo;s Hottest Ticket,&rdquo; which discussed the fact that the tech world is hiring just as many people with arts backgrounds as those with tech training. Time ran an article about ten CEOs of wildly successful companies, like Starbucks, Hewlett-Packard and Avon, who have liberal arts degrees. The Globe and Mail recently wrote a profile of a National Ballet of Canada dancer turned physiatrist, and the article about Dr. Semple, the visual arts major who became a surgeon. And much has been made of the fact that visionary tech designer and developer Steve Jobs took a creative writing course and studied calligraphy in his pre-Apple days (which he talked about extensively in his now famous Stanford University convocation address).</p>\n<p>So, what&rsquo;s going on here? Is everyone just tickled by the idea that our high school guidance counsellors screwed up, that despite their wellmeaning advice, we can build a successful career without an undergraduate degree in business or engineering?</p>\n<p>Yes, there are a good number of us who are happy that our guidance counsellors were wrong&mdash;about university courses, about career choices, about our chances of ending up in jail.

We need to still value the work of care - at least as much as we value the resume.</p>\n<h4>2.Care is not Only the Woman's Responsibility</h4>\n<p>Yes, we need to put an equal value on care, however, that does not mean it should only be the woman's responsibility. We need to get the men in our lives involved. Care is converting income into meals, and shelter, and discipline, etc. and the most important thing we can do is invest in the first five years of the next generation.</p>\n<h4>3. We Must Recognize and Support the Lead Parent</h4>\n<p>People are much more likely to flourish with a greater support system at home. Look at the men who are stepping up as lead parent, support them and see them as secure and important. Men should get the same opportunities for care -- parental leave, be able to move for their spouse--and we need to treat ment the exact same as women.</p>\n<h4>4. Parenting is similar to leadership</h4>\n<p>If you were to pick up a book on parenting and a book on leadership, you'd be surprised how similar the advice is. When you invest in someone, and that person succeeds, you'll feel pourd. Think of advice you've been given on either topic and see how it could apply.</p>\n<h4>5. We Need to Change How We Raise Our Sons</h4>\n<p>We've changed the way we've raised our daughters, but we need to change socially imposed gender roles and what we teach our sons about being equal care givers. Not only will valuin care open chances for women leaders, it changes the way we think about and treat men. It changes the expectations of men and that's just equality, making you a better leader and manager.</p>",

      "description": "<h4>1. Stop Shoving People Down the Marketing Funnel</h4>\n<p>The marketing funnel is an outdated framework to guide decision making, but we can&rsquo;t expect our customers to follow a specific path down the &ldquo;funnel&rdquo;. Consider the See, Think, Do, Care framework instead. It is a measurement strategy (not a funnel or pre-determined path) that focuses on four clusters of intent.</p>\n<h4>2. Solve For Intent</h4>\n<p>Forget about demographics; it&rsquo;s worlds more important to focus on behaviour. There are the four different audience intent clusters and we need to make sure we solve for all four. When determining the success of your initiatives, do not judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree; use proper metrics tied back to the intent.</p>\n<h4>3. Don't be Short-Sighted</h4>\n<p>Make sure you are solving for future intent too; just because they aren&rsquo;t buying from you now, doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t in the future. Hook them in with your content so that you&rsquo;re on their radar when it comes time to make a purchase. And please&hellip; don&rsquo;t have one night stands with your audience; make sure you are building those relationships.</p>\n<h4>4. Social selling does not work</h4>\n<p>To find success in social media, your content needs to entertain, inform and provide utility. Consider the Money-off-Roof Test (MoR for short). If you could create more &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; by throwing the money off the roof of your office, then don&rsquo;t invest it in that social media initiative.</p>\n<h4>5. Stop With Data Pukes</h4>\n<p>When communicating results to the CEO level, give less data and information and more plain English. They don&rsquo;t need to see your graphs, your analysis, or your process &ndash; they pay you to do that, so focus on simplifying it in ways they would understand.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Many small businesses don't know their own competitive advantage, until they hear it right from their happy customer's mouth. Seeking feedback from customers is an effective way to grow your business. All you have to do, is ask the right questions.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Constantly seeking feedback from your customers is a great way to learn how to market your business more effectively. If you&rsquo;ve never done this before, do it immediately as it is one of the best ways to discover what you do that actually differentiates you from your competition.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve worked with a small business that had no idea what its competitive advantage was until we heard it right from the mouths of happy customers. Seeking feedback is also a great way to get better and plug gaps. I can tell you that if you&rsquo;re not receiving a large amount of your business by way of referral or word of mouth, you&rsquo;ve probably got some gaps in your processes.</p>\n<p>Below are five questions I like to pose to customers as they can provide a great discussion base for getting at what&rsquo;s truly important to you and your customers. Create a form and get in the habit of surveying a handful of customers every month. I think you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with tremendous insight and you&rsquo;ll also find that your customers enjoy being asked what they think. One word of caution, don&rsquo;t accept vague answers like &ldquo;you provide good service.&rdquo; While that may be true and good to hear, you can&rsquo;t work with that. Push a bit and ask what good service looks like and maybe even if they can tell you about a specific instance in which they felt they got good service.</p>\n<h4>1. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO HIRE US/ BUY FROM US IN THE FIRST PLACE?</h4>\n<p>This is a good baseline question for your marketing. It can get at how effective your advertising, message and lead conversion processes are working. I&rsquo;ve also heard customers talk about the personal connection or culture that felt right in this question.</p>\n<h4>2. WHAT&rsquo;S ONE THING WE DO BETTER THAN OTHERS YOU DO BUSINESS WITH?</h4>\n<p>In this question you are trying to discover something that you can work with as a true differentiator. This is probably the question you&rsquo;ll need to work hardest at getting specifics. You want to look for words and phrases and actual experiences that keep coming up over and over again, no matter how insignificant they may seem to you. If your customers are explaining what they value about what you do, you may want to consider making that the core marketing message for your business.</p>\n<h4>3. WHAT&rsquo;S ONE THING WE COULD DO TO CREATE A BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR YOU?</h4>\n<p>On the surface this question could be looked at as a customer service improvement question, and it may be, but the true gold in this question is when your customers can identify an innovation. Sometimes we go along doing what we&rsquo;ve always done and then out of the blue a customer says something like, &ldquo;I sure wish it came like this,&rdquo; and all of a sudden it&rsquo;s painfully clear how you can create a meaningful innovation to your products, services and processes. Push your customers to describe the perfect experience buying what you sell.</p>\n<h4>4. DO YOU REFER US TO OTHERS, AND IF SO, WHY?</h4>\n<p>This is the ultimate question of satisfaction because a truthful answer means your customer likes the product and likes the experience of getting the product. (You can substitute service here of course.) There&rsquo;s an entire consulting industry cropping up around helping people discover what Fred Reichheld called the Net Promoter Score in his book The Ultimate Question. Small businesses can take this a step deeper and start understanding specifically why they get referrals and perhaps the exact words and phrases a customer might use when describing to a friend why your company is the best.</p>\n<h4>5. WHAT WOULD YOU GOOGLE TO FIND A BUSINESS LIKE OURS?</h4>\n<p>This is the new lead generation question, but understanding what it implies is very important. If you want to get very, very good at being found online, around the world or around the town, you have to know everything you can about the actual terms and phrases your customers use when they go looking for companies like yours. Far too often businesses optimize their web sites around industry jargon and technical terms when people really search for &ldquo;stuff to make my life better.&rdquo;</p>",

      "description": "<p>Sales is tough. Even though there are over 22 million sales professionals in the United States and Canada Alone, only 10% will actually deliver ROI while 40% will miss quota.

Refine key selling skills. The most effective sales people have the selling skills needed to sell faster and better. And these all-important selling skills are directly related to the buyers&rsquo; experiences.</p>\n<h4>1. The Skill of Education</h4>\n<p>Today, buyers can find a lot of information they seek online. They can read reviews of products and companies. They can learn all about the different features and price points available to them. They can compare and contrast different options. And they can ask for advice and recommendations on social media.</p>\n<p>The buyer&rsquo;s journey has changed and sales people are no longer the main point of contact when customers are seeking information, so you need to sell in a way that matches the way buyers now shop. Once buyers do come to you, you need to be able to bring value to the table. You need to go above and beyond when it comes to providing valuable advice and content because your buyers will be more knowledgeable and informed than ever before. You need to give them information they can&rsquo;t find anywhere else, you need to offer brilliant new ideas they haven&rsquo;t thought of, and you need to give a new perspective. Otherwise, why would they come to you? When you focus on being a valuable resource, you&rsquo;ll win over your prospects.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">2. The Skill of Collaboration</h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Collaboration isn&rsquo;t most sales people&rsquo;s strong suit. They&rsquo;re used to working alone and being in control. If this sounds like you, you&rsquo;re probably hindering your chances of making the sale because you don&rsquo;t play well with others.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Buyers now want to be an active part of the purchasing process. They don&rsquo;t want you to tell them what to buy. They want to work with you to find the best solutions, so you need to start playing nice and work with them to co-create value.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">3. The Skill of Communication</h4>\n<p>In just about any field, communication is an important skill to have. But in sales it&rsquo;s one of the most critical selling skills that you must perfect in order to close deals. You need to be able to write persuasive sales copy, emails, and presentations. You need to be able to paint a picture that your prospects can visualize. You need to be able to communicate emotions and to share ideas in a believable and clear way. This is how you&rsquo;ll close sales.</p>\n<h4>4. The Skill of Active Listening</h4>\n<p>Of course, you hear things each moment of every day, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re actually listening. Active listening is a selling skill that many sales people take for granted. But buyers want to be heard&mdash;and I mean really be heard. They want to know they&rsquo;re the priority in the sales process, as are their needs, wants, and challenges. They don&rsquo;t want you to talk, talk, and talk about features, benefits, and prices. They want to know that you care about their needs, and this comes from actively listening to them.</p>\n<h4>5. The Skill of Empathy</h4>\n<p>In the past, aggressive and persuasive sales tactics worked fairly well, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be using them today. Buyers do not want to feel the least bit pressured into a sale. In fact, buyers are inherently distrusting of you, so you need to develop your empathy if you want to close deals. Prospects will buy from sales people they like and trust so connecting with them is critical. When you perfect empathy, you&rsquo;ll be able to build trust, build relationships, and close deals.</p>",

Voice/call usage is dropping big, as messaging, streaming and mobile data usage explodes. Think about the timeframe between the creation of mobile devices to now. Amazing.

Now, not only has that hurdle been jumped over (and, in the blink of an eye), but hardly anybody uses these smart&rdquo;phones&rdquo; to talk on at all. Voice/call usage is dropping big, as messaging, streaming and mobile data usage explodes. Think about the timeframe between the creation of mobile devices to now. Amazing. The main reason that the technology was created and adopted has become the least important functionality that people care about. The problem, of course, is that businesses are the ones left having to build on that infrastructure... and deal with it. So, yes, deal with it.</p>\n<p>Simply complaining that it&rsquo;s expensive doesn&rsquo;t solve for the consumer or future-proof your brand today. If your consumer can meet another human being and get intimate with a few flicks of their thumbs on an iPhone, how much more difficult are you making it for them to connect with your business?</p>"

Disruption is pervasive&mdash;it&rsquo;s happening in the tech industry (where change is the only constant!) and I see it every day in our clients&rsquo; industries. What&rsquo;s most important in this time of rapid change is how leaders respond to lead their companies through it. Digital disruptors prey on complacency. Now is not the time for business as usual. All companies need to act like challengers and embrace disruption to reimagine their businesses.</p>\n<p>So how are some of today&rsquo;s top CEOs responding? As part of our research, we also looked at what the leaders of the world&rsquo;s most successful companies do differently. We identified a small group of organizations that have both a strong reputation as leading innovators and a solid financial track record. The Torchbearers, as we call them, comprise only four percent of CEO interviewees, but they provide valuable guidance from which leaders and aspiring leaders everywhere can learn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a leader of a company that is experiencing and enabling some of this disruption, much of what these CEOs share rings true with my experience. They realize they need to sharpen strategies, energize engagement and accelerate transformation to win. Here are some of the highlights of what they told us as well as some of my own observations&hellip;</p>\n<p><strong>SHARPEN YOUR STRATEGY</strong></p>\n<p>Pursue disruptive innovation, not just incremental improvements. Torchbearer CEOs look for ways to exploit new and emerging technologies or business models, or apply&nbsp;old technologies in new ways, and look at other industries for ideas. They experiment with new revenue models that might provide additional sources of value and a stronger customer experience. And when they&rsquo;re launching something new, they aim to cross the finish line first.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, speed is one of the biggest challenges but also one of the most important factors in success when it comes to disruption and transformation - speed of acceptance, speed of knowledge acquisition for the &ldquo;new world&rdquo; and speed of transition and execution. As a leader, you are constantly challenged with resistance to change, so creating the right environment for it is key. To help enable this, leaders need to challenge comfortable behaviours and assumptions while creating a safe environment for breakthrough insights.</p>\n<p>I motivate my team to continually act as challengers and not champions. We must work harder, smarter and faster than our competitors for the sake of our clients and at no time act as though we are on top. I think that comes from the Hamilton, Ontario Steel Town boy in me&hellip;act like you have to fight for everything you have and fight even harder to keep it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have always believed that action inspires reaction. Too many times we are waiting for something to happen or to have the perfect insight to act. I would rather make mistakes that we can correct on our path to successful outcomes than to wait for the perfect moment to act.</p>\n<p><strong>ENERGIZE YOUR ENGAGEMENT</strong></p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no question that data is increasing for every industry at a phenomenal pace. Unstructured data like videos, medical images and social content will be the majority of data in the world and is expected to reach 44 zettabytes by 2020. That&rsquo;s 1.6 billion years of HD video. Torchbearers know the implications of this. They employ more sophisticated predictive and cognitive analytics techniques than their competitors to decipher their data. And with these technologies, leaders can quickly investigate new trends, identify new customer segments and engage with customers at a deeply human level, as well as make smarter business decisions. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to be able to do this? However, data insights should never supersede a leader&rsquo;s intuition to take risks and take action. I use data to guide me but to stand out among our competitors I will take risks that are not just supported by data.</p>\n<p><strong>TURBOCHARGE YOUR TRANSFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>I am never satisfied with the pace at which we accomplish our objectives. As a leader, I spend more time setting challenging timelines to success and managing and leading the team to overcome obstacles to achieve those timelines. There is no success in trying to catch your competitor, you must set the pace for your team and lead the market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Top leaders today realize that speed is critical and they build a culture of rapid experimentation and prototyping to accelerate the release of new business models, products and services. They are prepared to make long-term investments in innovation, not just the sort of investments that deliver better quarter-to-quarter financial performance. They define the skills they will need in the future, as industries converge and ecosystems predominate. A leader must anticipate the market demand and prepare their team with skills and investments to capitalize on it. One of my favourite quotes is: &ldquo;the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare.&rdquo;&nbsp;Focus on what the market and your clients need and partner with other organizations, including competitors, to ensure you can bring the best forward. This will only strengthen the market and your brand. There is enough business to share with competitors if we are jointly making our clients successful.</p>\n<p><strong>STAY TRUE TO YOUR PURPOSE AND VALUES</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the guidance above from the Torchbearer CEOs, I&rsquo;d like to add a couple of things I&rsquo;ve learned based on my nearly 30 years of IBM leadership experience. I strongly believe that staying true to your company&rsquo;s purpose and values is absolutely essential to long-term success. The world has changed considerably over the past 100 years and while there is ample evidence of IBM&rsquo;s ability to adapt and reinvent ourselves to meet ever-changing marketplace needs, there is also evidence of our commitment to core values, which have always been at the centre of our transformation efforts: Dedication to every client&rsquo;s success; Innovation that matters &mdash; for our company and for the world and Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships. I am personally proud to be associated with living and leading these values at IBM.</p>\n<p>Today, we are more of a services provider and less of a hardware, software business. We transformed to a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, yet we remain true to our heritage as a team of collaborative forwardthinkers, focused on being essential as we make business and society work better.</p>\n<p>In order to do this, we need to remain close to our clients and our people. I am actively engaged in meeting with clients and I engage daily at all levels within IBM. I am constantly learning of what is changing and what I need to change. My&nbsp;team and clients can count on my commitment to listen and take action.</p>\n<p><strong>ALIGN LEADERSHIP TEAM TO ACTIVATE AND DRIVE CHANGE</strong></p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not just my commitment that counts. This kind of commitment needs to be nurtured, reinforced and brought to life throughout the organization, with every leader leading by example.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Transformational leaders do more than embrace change &ndash; they activate and drive change at all levels. Their mindset must be one of changing the culture, with a focus on moving the team out of their comfort zone and into a new era of doing business. Based on my experience, this requires significant communication, guidance and reassurance, while creating a strong sense of confidence in the change of direction. At the same time, a leader must quickly identify those that are engaged and supportive of the change and make these leaders of change examples to all others. It also means having the courage to move out those that resist change and fail to adapt, regardless of their institutional knowledge. They also know the value in engaging new employees and bringing new talent into the company to allow for fresh perspectives and energy to execute change.</p>\n<p>CEOs clearly understand they need to prepare for a future in which disruption is pervasive, where competition is completely redefined and transformation is inevitable. While it will certainly be challenging, if leaders follow the guidance above, I am confident they will be better positioned to navigate these tumultuous times ahead of us. What an exciting time to be a leader!</p>",
