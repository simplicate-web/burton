      "description": "<p>Gary Vaynerchuk is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and American businessman who was born in Belarus and immigrated to the United States as a young child. Gary’s entrepreneurial instincts took over at a young age, when he owned a franchise of neighborhood lemonade stands and made $1,000 a weekend selling baseball cards. Much to his dismay, his father Sasha pulled Gary into the family business, a local liquor store called Shopper’s Discount Liquors. Before long, Gary recognized that consumers collected rare wines just like people collected baseball cards, and he was off to the races. Gary transformed himself into a wine expert, rebranded the store as <a href=\"http://winelibrary.com/\">Wine Library</a>, launched a retail website in 1997, and by 2008 he had raised annual revenue from $4 million to $60 million. In 2006 Gary achieved one of his life-long goals when he was caricatured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in an article about online wine sales.</p><p>In February of 2006, Gary launched <a href=\"http://tv.winelibrary.com/\">Wine Library TV</a>, a daily video blog about wine. With the tag line “changing the wine world,” the show offered an unpretentious approach to an historically stuffy subject. As the audience grew and word spread of his informal and unorthodox approach to wine, Gary made numerous national television appearances as a wine expert, including spots on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, The Ellen Degeneres Show, The Today Show, Nightline, and Mad Money with Jim Cramer. In 2009, Gary was recognized as “Innovator of the Year” by <em>Wine Enthusiast</em> magazine, and as part of <em>Decanter</em> magazine’s prestigious “Power List” of the most influential figures in the industry. Wine Library TV garners 90,000 daily viewers and has now surpassed 800 episodes, featuring celebrity guests including hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, Travel Channel star Samantha Brown, Food Network host Ingrid Hoffmann, rock star Maynard James Keenan, Digg.com founder Kevin Rose, and esteemed wine critics Jancis Robinson and Daniel Rogov.</p><p>While developing the audience for Wine Library TV, Gary eschewed the traditional media tools he had relied on when building the retail store, turning instead to the social web. Gary joined the online conversation by becoming an active member of blogs and forums, and then proceeded to utilize web 2.0 tools such as Facebook and Twitter to connect with consumers online. The business world took note of Gary’s approach, and before long he was being invited to speak at conferences and corporations around the world.</p><p>Gary launched a second blog, garyvaynerchuk.com, where he dispenses business advice and comments on emerging technologies and cultural trends. As his following grew online, Gary became one of the first to reach Facebook’s friend limit and accumulated more than 800,000 followers on Twitter. Gary’s first business book, entitled <a href=\"http://crushitbook.com/\"><em>Crush It! Why Now is the Time to Cash in on your Passion</em></a>, was released in the Fall of 2009 and debuted as a <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestseller. Gary proceeded to make tv appearances as a social media expert and business consultant on programs including CNN Your $$$$, Fox Business’s Your Money Your Questions, and The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch.</p><p>As Gary’s career as a speaker and writer continued to soar, companies of varying sizes approached him for consulting advice. The consulting role agreed with him, and in 2009 Gary and his brother AJ co-founded <a href=\"http://vaynermedia.com/\">VaynerMedia</a>, a boutique agency that works with personal brands, consumer brands, and startups. Gary is now also an angel investor in various startups, offering sweat equity to the projects he supports in addition to financial investments.</p><p>Gary’s ultimate goal is to one day own the New York Jets. Although his various businesses obviously play an enormous role in his life, he always puts his family first.</p>",

She is the author of the NYTimes Business Bestseller Selling with Integrity as well as 5 other books and hundreds of articles that explain different aspects of the decision facilitation model that teaches buyers how to buy.</p><p>Morgen dramatically shifts the buying decision tools from solution-focused to decision-support. Sales very competently manages the solution placement end of the decision, yet buyers have been left on their own while sellers are left waiting for a response, and hoping they can close. But no longer: Morgen actually gives sellers the tools to lead buyers through all of their internal, idiosyncratic decisions.</p><p>Morgen teaches Buying Facilitation® to global corporations, and she licenses the material with training companies seeking to add new skills to what they are already offering their clients. She has a new book coming out October 15, 2009 called <em>Dirty Little Secrets</em>: why buyers can’t buy and sellers can’t sell and what you can do about it which defines what is happening within buyer’s cultures (systems) and explains how they make the decisions they make.</p><p>Morgen has focused on the servant-leader/decision facilitation aspect of sales since her first book came out in 1992, called Sales On The Line.</p><p>In all of her books, she unmasks the behind-the-scenes decisions that need to go on before buyers choose a solution, and gives sellers the tools to aid them.</p><p>In addition, Morgen changes the success rate of sales from the accepted 10% to 40%: the time it takes buyers to come up with their own answers is the length of the sales cycle, and her books – especially <em>Dirty Little Secrets </em>– teaches sellers how to guide the buyers through to all of their decisions, thereby shifting the sales cycle from a failed model that only manages half of the buying cycle, to a very competent Professional skill set.</p><p>Morgen lives in Austin TX, where she dances and works with children’s fund raising projects in her spare time.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Founder of The Corcoran Group & Bestselling author of <em>Shark Tales How I Turned $1,000 into a Billion Dollar Business</em>.</p><p>Barbara Corcoran Inc. was founded by real estate entrepreneur Barbara Corcoran in 2005 as the latest endeavor in her high- profile, multi-faceted, and highly successful career. This multi- media company blends Barbara’s real estate expertise and her growing media presence in a one-of-a-kind package that taps Barbara’s many talents.</p><p>As founder of The Corcoran Group, Barbara used her ingenuity, quick wits, and solid instincts to turn a $1,000 loan into a multi-billion dollar business. In the 28 years Barbara ran the company, she honed her skills in marketing, negotiating, innovating, and surviving in the lean times and thriving in the good times—everything you need to know to establish, run, and grow a business. Then, in 2001, Barbara sold the company for over $70 million.</p><p>Barbara next put her entrepreneurial knowledge down on paper, penning the best selling, unconventional business book <em>If You Don’t Have Big Breasts, Put Ribbons on Your Pigtails</em>. The book is aptly sub-titled And Other Business Lessons I Learned From My Mom, as Barbara credits her mom’s good sense and positive vision with giving her the tools she needed to succeed so fabulously in the notoriously cut throat world of NewYork real estate. Her second book, <em>Nextville: Amazing Places to Live the Rest of Your Life</em>, is fast on its way to becoming her second best seller.</p><p>As a much-in-demand motivational speaker, and now a bestselling author, Barbara has successfully transitioned from her role as head of The Corcoran Group to that of popular television personality. Today Barbara is the real estate contributor to NBC’s TODAY Show and a ‘shark’ on the ABC reality show Shark Tank. She can also be seen on HGTV’s Top Ten and LXTV’s Price Fix. In addition, Barbara is a regular columnist for the New York Daily News and MORE Magazine.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Two big wins. From nothing. And now he’s back to his first to try for his third. That’s Andy Nulman’s story in a nutshell. While young in spirit and snappy in dress, Andy Nulman has been creating and leading major media projects for 35 years.<br /> <br /> At the age of 23 Nulman joined a tiny two-night, French-language humour start-up in Montreal. When he left 15 years later as its CEO and driving force, the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival was the biggest and most prestigious of its kind on earth, attracting more than 2 million visitors over a month-long period. During his tenure, Andy worked with the likes of Jay Leno, Drew Carey, Jim Carrey, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Ray Romano, Martin Short, Tina Fey and Adam Sandler, sold multi-million dollar corporate sponsorships and created/Executive Produced over 150 Festival TV shows, in a variety of languages, all over the world.<br /> <br /> Then came Airborne Mobile. In 1999, Nulman co-founded this pioneering company in the new industry of mobile media and marketing. Most people, including Airborne’s early investors, didn’t give the firm much chance to survive its first year. Less than seven years later, Airborne was honored as North America’s 4th-Fastest Growing Tech Company in Deloitte’s Fast 500 ranking, and sold to Japan’s Cybird Holdings for $110 million. What’s more, three years after that, he and his partner bought it back. For way, way less. No wonder he speaks about, and teaches others, How To Do The Impossible...whatever theirs may be.<br /> <br /> These days, Nulman is back with big, groundshaking plans of change as President of Festivals and Television to Just for Laughs and its French component Juste Pour Rire. As his title suggests, he will take charge of Just for Laughs/Juste Pour Rire as well as the upstart festivals in Toronto and Chicago, plus the company’s television production arms.<br /> <br /> In his spare time, Andy is also an oft-published author (three books, including the breakthrough marketing effort Pow! Right Between The Eyes—Profiting From The Power of Surprise), gutsy public speaker, half-decent snowboarder, gym rat, contemporary art buff, newbie hockey right-winger (a convert after two decades as a goalie) and weekend blogger.<br /> <br /> Other accomplishments include being named one of Canada’s Top 40 Under 40 business leaders by the Financial Post, voted one of the Top 100 Montrealers of the 20th Century in 2000, and honored with the McGill Management Achievement Award in 2004.</p>",

She has taught on a wide variety of topics at Columbia for MBA and Executive MBA students, including leadership, decision making, creativity, and globalization, earning an Innovation in the Teaching Curriculum award along the way. Dr. Iyengar was also recently selected by Columbia University’s President’s Office to teach at the Global Leadership Fellows Program at the World Economics Forum in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>One of the world’s experts on choice, Dr. Iyengar received a dual degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1992, consisting of a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School of Business and a B.A. in psychology with a minor in English from the College of Arts and Sciences. In 1997 she completed her Ph.D. in social psychology from Stanford University. During her studies at Stanford, Dr. Iyengar became interested in how people make choices, particularly the importance and universality of choice in people’s lives. Her dissertation, entitled “Choice and its Discontents,” received the prestigious Best Dissertation Award for 1998 from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.</p><p>Dr. Iyengar’s innovative research on choice has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of mental Health, and the National Security Education Program. In 2002, she was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Social Scientists by the Executive Office of the President.</p><p>Throughout her career, her research has not only appeared in many respected academic journals but is also regularly cited in the media, including periodicals such as Fortune and Time magazines, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, on National Public Radio, and in popular books including Blink by Malcolm Gladwell and The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz.</p><p>It is her passion for this subject matter that led Dr. Iyengar down the extraordinary path of writing The Art of Choosing. Whether mundane or life-altering, choices define us and shape our lives. In her book, Dr. Iyengar asks the difficult questions about how and why we choose: Is the desire for choice innate or bound by culture? Why do we sometimes choose against our best interests? How much control do we really have over what we choose? Dr. Iyengar’s award-winning research reveals that the answers are surprising and profound. In our world of shifting political and cultural forces, technological revolution, and interconnected commerce, our decisions have far-reaching consequences.Sheena Iyengar’s parents immigrated to New York from Delhi, India by way of Toronto, Canada, where she was born. Her original introduction to New York was in Flushing, Queens, but she spent most of her childhood in Elmwood Park, New Jersey. Currently a resident of New York, Dr. Iyengar is married and has a five year old son.</p>",

Taylor</strong> is an agenda-setting writer, speaker and entrepreneur who has helped to shape the global conversation about the best ways to compete, innovate and succeed. His latest project, <em>Practically Radical: Not-So-Crazy Ways to Transform Your Company, Shake Up Your Industry, and Challenge Yourself</em>, is based on in-depth access to 25 organizations that are making deep-seated changes under trying circumstances. These organizations (from hard-charging technology companies to long-established nonprofits, from hospitals to automakers to banks) are mastering a set of strategies and practices that define the work of leadership in turbulent times—ideas from which every leader can learn.?</p><p><em>Practically Radical</em> is a sequel of sorts to Bill’s most recent book, <em>Mavericks at Work: Why the Most Original Minds in Business Win</em>. “I didn’t just ’read’ this book, I devoured it!” declared Tom Peters when <em>Mavericks</em> appeared. Just weeks after its release, <em>Mavericks</em> became a<em> New York Times</em> Best Seller, a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> Business Best Seller and a <em>BusinessWeek</em> Best Seller. The <em>Economist</em> called the book “a pivotal work in the tradition of <em>In Search of Excellence</em> and <em>Good to Great</em>.” The <em>Economist</em> also named <em>Mavericks</em> one of its “Books of the Year.” Other accolades include: “Top Ten Business Book of The Year” (amazon.com), “Top Ten Book on Innovation and Design” (<em>BusinessWeek</em>), and “Picks of the Year in Business Books” (<em>The Financial Times</em>).</p><p><em>Practically Radical</em> and <em>Mavericks at Work</em> are just the latest chapters in a career devoted to challenging conventional wisdom and showcasing the power of business at its best. As cofounder and founding editor of <em>FastCompany</em>, Bill launched a magazine that won countless awards, earned a passionate following among executives and entrepreneurs around the world—and became a legendary business success. In less than six years, an enterprise that took shape in some borrowed office space in Harvard Square sold for $340 million. <em>Fast Company</em> has won just about every award there is to win in the magazine world, from “Startup of the Year” to “Magazine of the Year” to two National Magazine Awards.</p><p>In recognition of <em>Fast Company’s</em> impact on business, Bill was named “Champion of Workplace Learning and Performance” by the American Society of Training and Development. Past winners include Jack Welch of GE and Fred Smith of FedEx. Bill is also an adjunct lecturer at Babson College, America’s top-rated school for entrepreneurship, where he created the “Maverick Seminar at Babson College” — a unique academic program in which MBA students interact with the ideas and innovators creating the future of business. He is the co-author of three other books on strategy, leadership, and innovation. Bill has published numerous essays and CEO interviews in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, and his column, “Under New Management,” ran in the Sunday Business section of The <em>New York Times</em>. He now writes a <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/taylor/\">popular management blog</a> for <em>Harvard Business Review</em>. A graduate of Princeton University and the MIT Sloan School of Management, he lives in Wellesley, Massachusetts, with his wife and two daughters.</p>",

      "description": "<p>In a sense, Scooter Braun has been building SB Projects since he was a kid - observing the world around him, listening to the diverse stories of people he encountered, taking every opportunity presented to him, and always looking to the future. A key to his company’s success has been his uncanny ability to see things that others don’t, to recognize untapped talent and potential. Scooter is deeply attuned to popular culture, emerging media and technology, and social entrepreneurship. By seeing connections that are invisible to others, Braun is creating a groundbreaking fusion of the music, entertainment, technology and philanthropy fields. It is this vision that has made him one of TIME Magazine’s 2013 ’100 Most Influential People in the World’, landed him the cover of Billboard’s 2013 ’40 Under 40’ at the age of thirty-one and named one of Fast Company’s ’Most Creative People in Business.</p><p>Widely recognized for his work under SB Projects with Justin Bieber, Braun has built a management company, record label and publishing company that includes artists PSY, Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepsen and The Wanted. In addition to this, SB Projects has created several subsidiaries: Silent Labs, a tech incubator that has made various technology investments in promising startups such as Songza, Uber and Spotify; SB TV, which has a variety of scripted and unscripted projects in development with major networks and some of the most creative people in television; and SB Films, whose first project was NEVER SAY NEVER, the highest grossing concert film in domestic box office history. With more television, film and tech projects in the works, Braun’s business continues to impact and intersect new verticals and traditional industries creating an all-encompassing entertainment group.</p><p>Deep-rooted beliefs in the importance of giving back has lead Braun to incorporate philanthropic initiatives to all that he does. Encouraging artists to do the same, Braun is also heavily involved in PENCILS OF PROMISE, a non-profit organization that builds schools in the developing world. The organization has helped to build more than 130 schools in Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>",

Applying the knowledge he has accrued over decades in the industry, Stephen is able to see what others can’t: opportunities to improve innovation models and the cultures that support them.</p><p>The first innovation opportunity Stephen spotted was the opportunity to innovate within his own life.

Since then he has published four more books – Goal-Free Living (2006), The Little Book of Big Innovation Ideas (2007), Personality Poker (2010) and Best Practices are Stupid (2011) — and spoken to audiences in 50 different countries.</p><p>Today, Stephen continues to focus on transforming the way businesses like 3M, P&G, Marriott, Nike, and Microsoft to improve innovation practices through customized and keynote speeches, advisory engagements and other services. Passionate and captivating, Stephen’s high-energy approach to innovation gets audiences out of their seats and into new ways of thinking about their business challenges.</p><p>Stephen currently serves on the Board of Directors of National Speakers Association (NSA) and is the recipient of the Certified Speaking Professional (CSP) designation, NSA’s highest earned designation.

Later, Stone co-founded Twitter which launched in 2006.

His new show <em>World’s Weirdest Restaurants</em> debut’s on <em>Food Network Canada,</em> April 4.</p><p>In <em>World’s Weirdest Restaurants</em>, the passionate and indefatigable gastronaut circles the globe in his quest to find the world’s weirdest and wackiest restaurants. Some of his discoveries include a Japanese isakaya where Macaque monkeys serve beer, a New York City pop-up where patrons dine in the nude, and Modern Toilet in Taipei where curry is served in miniature porcelain toilet bowls.</p><p>On <em>Surreal Gourmet</em> and in his books, Bob transforms ordinary ingredients into wow-inspiring dishes through simple cooking methods and whimsical presentations. Along with his iconic Toastermobile, they have become his culinary trademark. Blumer’s artful approach to cooking, confidence-inspiring instructions, and contagious enthusiasm endear him to a loyal following in North America, Asia, and Europe—territories where he travels regularly.</p><p>On <em>Glutton for Punishment</em>, Bob channels his passion for food and his competitive nature into a series of culinary adventures that are inspiring, entertaining and often amusing. In every episode, he has five days to learn a physically daunting culinary skill, then he is thrown to the wolves as he competes in a related professional competition, or attempts to rise to the occasion of a challenge. In the fifth and final season of the show, Bob successfully broke or established six food-related <em>Guinness World Records.</em></p><p>Bob is also the author of five acclaimed cookbooks and the co-author of the bestselling <em>Pizza on the Grill</em>. His most recent book <em>Glutton for Pleasure: signature recipes, epic stories and surreal etiquette</em> was summed up by <em>Publisher’s Weekly</em> as “Equal parts memoir, lavish art book, multi-genre soundtrack and culinary tour de force.”</p><p>When he is not traveling for work or pleasure—which is most of the time—the transplanted Canadian cycles daily in the canyons near his home in the Hollywood Hills, doing his best to stay in shape for his next big adventure.</p>",

      "description": "<p>As an Executive Creative Director at Young & Rubicam Advertising in New York, <strong>James P. Othmer</strong> developed brand visions and award-winning creative material for some of the world’s leading corporations, including AT&T, Accenture, Dannon, Citibank, KFC and Colgate. During this time he also developed an acute sense of the absurdities of modern life. First came his widely-praised 2006 novel The Futurist, then came ADLAND: Searching for the Meaning of Life on a Branded Planet, a funny and sneakily profound book that bestselling author Daniel H. Pink says is “destined to become a classic of its kind—a must read for anyone brave (or insane or aimless) enough to toil in the fields of modern advertising.” His newest book is <em>Holy Water</em>, a hilarious, satirical and poignant book that takes a look at a man at a crossroads—and how bottled water just might be key to his salvation.</p><p>He has spoken to groups as diverse as university students and fast-food franchisee conventions, to gatherings of C-Suite and new media executives. A refugee of the corporate world with many more tales to tell, Jim combines the storytelling wit of David Sedaris with the unflinching corporate insights of Malcolm Gladwell.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Neil Rackham is known throughout the world as a speaker, writer, and seminal thinker on sales and marketing issues. Three of his books have been on the New York Times best seller list, and his works have been translated into over 50 languages. He has been Chairman and CEO of three international research and consulting firms.</p><p>In the 1970’s Neil first gained international recognition for his studies of sales effectiveness, when he led the largest ever research study of successful selling. This massive project, supported by major multinationals including Xerox and IBM, involved a team of 30 researchers who studied 35,000 sales calls in over 20 countries. The research took 12 years at a cost of $30 million, in today’s dollars. From the results of these studies he published the groundbreaking classic <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070511136/gotomarketparti-20\" target=\"_blank\">SPIN® Selling</a></em> (McGraw-Hill, 1988) and<em> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070511144/gotomarketparti-20\" target=\"_blank\">Major Account Sales Strategy</a></em> (McGraw-Hill, 1989). His books regularly rank among business best sellers, and <em>SPIN® Selling</em> is McGraw Hill’s best selling business book ever. He is author of over 50 influential articles on marketing, selling and channel strategy.</p><p>Neil’s other books include <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887305083/gotomarketparti-20\" target=\"_blank\">Managing Major Sales</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070517827/gotomarkparti-20\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Partnering Right: How Market Leaders Are Creating Long-Term Competitive Advantage</a></em>. His recent book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071342532/gotomarkparti-20\" target=\"_blank\">Rethinking The Sales Force</a> </em>has received wide acclaim from critics, academics, and salespeople. It is required reading at many leading business schools.</p><p>He has worked closely with many leading sales forces such as IBM, Xerox, AT&T, and Citicorp. He has also been an advisor on sales performance to several of the largest Fortune 100 companies in the United States.</p><p>Neil has worked extensively with senior partners in some of the world’s most successful professional services organizations including McKinsey & Company, where he was for many years a member of the Sales and Channel Management Group. He currently serves as Executive Advisor for <a href=\"http://www.gtmpartners.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Go To Market Partners</a>, a market strategy and sales effectiveness research and consulting firm.</p><p>Neil Rackham is also widely recognized as a highly original and creative trainer and communicator. His work in sales training won him the Instructional Systems Association award for Innovation in Training and Instruction, and more than half the Fortune 500 train their salespeople using sales models derived from his research.</p><p>He is a sought after conference speaker who receives top reviews from participants for his capacity to take complex issues and make them accessible and interesting. He uses a combination of humor, passion, and group interaction to stimulate and challenge his audiences.</p><p>Neil has a farm and winery in Northern Virginia and, when not working on improving sales performance, he writes poetry and science fiction, plays medieval musical instruments, and walks the Appalachian Trail.</p>",

      "tagline_short": "Bestselling Author of In Search of Excellence",
      "description": "<p>In 1982, with the publication of In Search of Excellence, Peters and Bob Waterman helped firms deal with a crushing competitive challenge to their primacy by urging them to get away from strategies based on just the numbers and re-focused on the basic drivers of all successful businesses throughout time: people, customers, values (culture), action-execution, and a perpetual selfrenewing entrepreneurial spirit. As “obvious” as these ideas are, they were, are and always will be the bedrock and differentiator of excellent enterprise and subject to constant and remarkably rapid slippage if left untended for even a moment. Peters and Waterman also effectively introduced the world of business to the notion of Excellence per se, a state of mind and daily practice not normally associated with enterprise and an inspiring and pragmatic and profitable aspiration.</p><p>In 1999, In Search of Excellence was honored by NPR as one of the “Top Three Business Books of the Century;” it was ranked as the “greatest business book of all time” in a poll by Britain’s Bloomsbury Publishing and was the most widely held library book in the United States from 1989 to 2006. Peters has followed Search with well over a dozen additional international bestsellers. Among them: A Passion for Excellence (with Nancy Austin); Thriving on Chaos; Liberation Management (acclaimed as the “Management Book of the Decade” for the ’90s) the provocative, colorful Re-imagine: Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age, and The Little Big Things: 163 Ways to Pursue Excellence.</p><p>Peters, praised by Thinkers50 as “Charismatic, passionate and insightful, [he] virtually invented the modern thought leadership industry,” was among the first class of the thinkers inducted into the “Thinkers50 Hall of Fame” in 2013. When the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI), a Swiss think tank, and MIT created “Thought Leaders 2014: The Most Influential Thinkers,” Peters was again amongst the greatest thinkers of our time. Using software-based calculations to determine answers to questions like “Whose ideas engage people most frequently?” and “Who are the most influential thinkers?”, they produced a simple influence rank or measure of the global importance of creative minds. Tom Peters is 32 on a list that includes Pope Francis and Tim Berners-Lee, among others.</p><p>Peters, who is widely credited with almost single-handedly “inventing” the public “management guru industry,” now global in scope and billions of dollars in size, writes, reflects and then presents about 30 seminars each year, well over half outside the U.S. He estimates that since 1978, when the work on Search began, he’s given well over 2,500 speeches, flown 5,000,000+ miles, spoken before 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 people and presented in 48 states and 67 countries. Also, since 2004, Peters has devoted significant “at home” energy to the awardwinning blog—www.tompeters.com.</p>",

      "description": "<p>For over fifty years, <strong>General Colin L. Powell</strong>, USA (Ret.) has devoted his life to public service. Having held senior military and diplomatic positions across four presidential administrations, Powell’s deep commitment to democratic values and freedom has been felt throughout the world.</p><p>The son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell was born in Harlem in April 1937 and was raised in the South Bronx. He was educated in the New York City public schools and after graduating from Morris High School attended the City College of New York where he earned a B.S. in Geology. It was not until he joined the Army ROTC program at CCNY that he discovered his calling and launched his military career. He received a commission as an Army second lieutenant upon graduation in 1958 and went on to serve in the United States Army for 35 years, rising to the rank of Four-Star General.</p><p>From 1987 – 1989 Powell served as President Ronald Reagan’s National Security Advisor. He served from 1989 – 1993 as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for both President George H.W. Bush and for President Bill Clinton, and was not only the youngest officer and first ROTC graduate to ever serve in the position but also was the first African American to do so. During his time as Chairman, he oversaw 28 crises to include the Panama intervention of 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in the victorious 1991 Persian Gulf War.</p><p>Under President George W. Bush, Powell was appointed the 65th Secretary of State and was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. As Secretary of State, he led the State Department in major efforts to address and solve regional and civil conflicts—in the Middle East, Sudan, Congo and Liberia, in the Balkans, Cyprus, Haiti, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Iraq and elsewhere. In all areas, he used the power of diplomacy to build trust, forge alliances and then help transform these unstable regions into areas where societies and cultures have the potential to prosper. He also worked at the forefront of American efforts to advance economic and social development worldwide.</p><p>Among the many U.S. Military awards and decorations Powell has received are the Defense Distinguished Service Medal (with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters), the Army Distinguished Service Medal (with Oak Leaf Cluster), Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit (with Oak Leaf Cluster), Soldier’s Medal, Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart. His civil awards include two Presidential Medals of Freedom, the President’s Citizens Medal, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Secretary of Energy Distinguished Service Medal. In addition, he has also received awards from over two-dozen countries to include a French Legion of Honor and an honorary knighthood bestowed by H.M. Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain.</p><p>Powell is the Founder of the Colin L. Powell Center for Leadership and Service at his alma mater, the City College of New York. The Center is student-focused with a mission to develop a new generation of publicly engaged leaders. He is the Founder and Chairman Emeritus of the America’s Promise Alliance, dedicated to forging a strong and effective partnership alliance committed to seeing that children have the fundamental resources they need to succeed.</p><p>Currently Powell is a strategic limited partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the renowned Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and is on the board of Bloom Energy. He is the Chairman of the Advisory Board of Leeds Equity Partners, a private equity firm focused on investments in the education, training, information and business services industries. He is also Chairman of the Eisenhower Fellowships, a cross-cultural program for emerging international leaders. He has previously served as a member of the Board of Trustees of Howard University, the Board of Directors of the United Negro College Fund, and the Board of Governors of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.</p><p>Powell is a member of the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations. He is on the Executive Leadership Cabinet of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial and is the Honorary Chairman of the education center for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He also serves on the board of the Smithsonian Institute’s African American Museum of History and Culture.</p><p>His autobiography, My American Journey, was a best seller and has been published in more than a dozen different languages. Powell’s second book, It Worked For Me (May, 2012), was an instant New York Times best seller and reveals the lessons that shaped his life and career.</p><p>Powell is married to the former Alma Vivian Johnson of Birmingham, Alabama. They live in McLean, Virginia and have three children and four grandchildren.</p>",

Through his 21 years as an astronaut, three spaceflights and 2600 orbits of Earth, Colonel Hadfield has become a worldwide sensation, harnessing the power of social media to make outer space accessible to millions and infusing a sense of wonder into our collective consciousness not felt since humanity first walked on the Moon. Called “the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong,” Colonel Hadfield continues to bring the marvels of science and space travel to everyone he encounters.</p><p>Colonel Hadfield is a pioneer of many historic “firsts”. In 1992, he was selected by the Canadian Space Agency as a NASA Mission Specialist—Canada’s first fully-qualified Space Shuttle crew member. Three years later, aboard Shuttle Atlantis, he was the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in space, and the first Canadian to board a Russian spacecraft as he helped build space station “Mir.” In 2001, aboard Shuttle Endeavour, Colonel Hadfield performed two spacewalks—the first Canadian to do so—and, in 2013, he was Commander of the International Space Station—the first and only Canadian to ever command a spaceship—so far.</p><p>During his multi-faceted career Hadfield has intercepted Soviet bombers in Canadian airspace, lived on the ocean floor, been NASA’s Director of Operations in Russia, and recorded science and music videos seen by hundreds of millions.</p><p>A heavily decorated astronaut, engineer, and pilot, Colonel Hadfield’s many awards include receiving the Order of Canada, the Meritorious Service Cross, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He was named the Top Test Pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and has been inducted into Canada’s Aviation Hall of Fame. He is the author of two internationally bestselling books, An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth and You Are Here, and has been commemorated on Canadian postage stamps, Royal Canadian Mint coins, and on Canada’s newest five dollar bill (along with fellow astronauts Steve MacLean and Dave Williams).</p>",

      "description": "<p>For five days in April 2009, the world was glued to their TV screens as Captain Richard Phillips became the center of an extraordinary international drama when he was captured by Somali pirates who hijacked his ship, the first hijacking of a U.S. ship in more than 200 years.</p><p>The hostage drama began on Wednesday, April 8th when a small band of pirates swung grappling hooks and climbed ropes from their skiff onto the Maersk Alabama, a container ship ferrying food aid to East Africa. Firing into the air as they leapt aboard the ship, many of the crew members scrambled into a designated safe room aboard the vessel.</p><p>To protect his crew, Captain Phillips made a conscious decision to put himself directly in harm’s way, knowing full well that he might pay the ultimate price for his decision. Amid the standoff, he offered himself as a hostage.</p><p>Once the pirates settled into one of the ship’s covered lifeboats, the crew attempted to trade the pirate they had captured for Captain Phillips. After they released their captive, the pirates refused to honor the agreement and fled with nine days of food rations and Captain Phillips. Held hostage as a human shield in a small lifeboat with three pirates, he had little to hope for or cling to — except the knowledge that he had done absolutely everything he could to save the lives of the 20 sailors aboard his ship.</p><p>The U.S. Navy responded to the scene, and negotiations were ongoing between the pirates and the captain of the USS Bainbridge. On Friday April 10th, Captain Phillips jumped out of the lifeboat and managed to swim a few yards toward the nearby destroyer, but the pirates went in after him and managed to haul him back in. The standoff dragged on until April 12th, when Navy SEAL snipers saw one of the pirates aim his AK-47 machine gun at Capt. Richard Phillips’ back and concluded he was in “imminent danger.”</p><p>Captain Richard Phillips is the author of A Captain’s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea, about his experience and his remarkable rescue. This dramatic story was also transformed into an Academy-Award and Golden-Globe nominated film, Captain Phillips, which hit the big screens in fall of 2013.</p>",

As he does in A Whole New</p><p>Mind and Drive, Pink draws on a rich trove of social science for his counterintuitive insights. He reveals the new ABCs of moving others (it’s no longer “Always Be Closing”), explains why extraverts don’t make the best salespeople, and shows how giving people an “off-ramp” for their actions can matter more than actually changing their minds. Along the way, Pink describes the six successors to the elevator pitch, the three rules for understanding another’s perspective, the five frames that can make your message clearer and more persuasive, and much more. The result is a perceptive and practical book–one that will change how you see the world and transform what you do at work, at school, and at home.</p><p>Pink’s articles on business and technology have appeared in many publications, including The New York Times, Harvard Business Review, The Sunday Telegraph, Fast Company and Wired. He has provided analysis of business trends on CNN, CNBC, ABC, NPR, and other networks in the U.S. and abroad. He also advises both Fortune 100 companies and startups on recruiting, innovation and work practices.</p><p>He received a B.A. from Northwestern University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and a J.D. from Yale Law School.</p><p>Pink lives in Washington, DC, with his wife and their three children.</p>",

With his research, his award-winning books and his lectures, Bob has been building an evidence-based management movement that brings together the worlds of management practice and rigorous research in ways that enriches both.</p><p>Robert I. Sutton is Professor of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University; co-leads Stanford’s Center for Work, Technology and Organization, is a faculty member in the Stanford Technology Ventures Program and a co-founder and active member of the new “d.school,” a multi-disciplinary program that teaches and spreads “design thinking.” Sutton is also an IDEO Fellow.</p><p>In his first book, The Knowing-Doing Gap, Bob explains why companies and managers can have good ideas—can know what to do—and still not do it. More importantly, he offers concrete guidance on how to turn this knowledge into effective action. The Knowing-Doing Gap was named “Best Management Book of 2000” by Management General.</p><p>The No Asshole Rule published in 2007 became a NY Times, Wall Street Journal, and Publishers Weekly Best-Seller. In 2009 Bob was given the privilege of writing the forward to the 40th Anniversary Edition of The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong, written by Dr. Laurence J. Peter & Raymond Hull. Released in September of 2010, Sutton’s latest book, Good Boss, Bad Boss: How to Be the Best... and Learn From the Worst, explores what it is that distinguishes great bosses from the good or mediocre ones, based upon the latest research in this field, including fascinating case studies, insights, and prescriptive tips.</p><p>Bob’s message is that turning sound ideas into action is the key to improving performance and his work shows how to make that happen. A genial, accessible and articulate speaker, Bob has consulted to companies and teaches executives and other professionals in Stanford’s professional education program. He has published over 90 articles and chapters in scholarly and applied publications and seven books and edited volumes. His research and opinions are often described in the press, and he has been a guest on numerous radio and television shows.</p>",

The Wall Street Journal ranked him one of the 10 Most Influential Business Thinkers.</p><p>His new book, Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence, argues that attention – a fundamental mental ability for success – has come under siege. Leadership that gets results demands a triple focus: on our inner world so we can manage ourselves; on others, for our relationships; and on the outer forces that shape our organizations and society itself. Dr. Goleman’s “The Focused Leader” won the 2013 HBR McKinsey Award, given each year for the best article in Harvard Business Review.</p><p>Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence was on The New York Times best sellers list for a year-and-a-half. Named one of the 25 “Most Influential Business Management Books” by TIME, it has been translated into 40 languages. HBR called emotional intelligence (EI) “a revolutionary, paradigm-shattering idea.” His follow-up, Working With Emotional Intelligence, outlined the vast importance of EI in any professional setting.</p><p>The groundbreaking Primal Leadership: Unleashing the Power of Emotional Intelligence, which Goleman co-wrote with Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee, unveiled scientific evidence proving that a leader’s emotional competencies have an enormous impact on an organization’s bottom line. His more recent books include Social Intelligence: The New Science of Social Relationships, Ecological Intelligence, and What Makes a Leader, a collection of articles from business journals. Co-founder of the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning and co-director of the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations, Goleman is currently editing a book from a recent dialogue with scientists and the Dalai Lama on ecology, interdependence, and ethics.</p><p>Goleman’s work on the brain and behavioural science was nominated twice for the Pulitzer Prize and recognized with the Washburn Award and Lifetime Career Award from the American Psychological Association. A former science journalist for The New York Times, he was named to the 2011 and 2013 Thinkers50 and a top business guru by Accenture Institute for Strategic Change. His article “What Makes a Leader?” remains the most requested reprint in the history of Harvard Business Review.</p>",

On her popular blog, <em>The Happiness Project</em>, she reports on her daily adventures in the pursuit of happiness.</p><p>In her next book, <em>Happier at Home</em>, Rubin embarked on a new project to explore how to make home a happier place. Starting in September (the new January), Gretchen dedicates a school year—from September through May—to concentrating on the factors that matter most for home, such as possessions, marriage, time, parenthood, body, neighborhood. The book’s title was inspired by a line from Samuel Johnson: “To be happy at home is the ultimate result of all ambition.”</p><p>Gretchen’s latest, <em>Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives</em>, tackles the critical question: How do we change? Gretchen Rubin’s answer: through habits. Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life. It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.</p><p>A graduate of Yale and Yale Law School, where she was Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Law Journal and winner of the Edgar M. Cullen Prize, Rubin started her career in law, and she was clerking for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor when she realized she really wanted to be a writer.</p><p>Rubin is much in demand as a speaker, and she has addressed corporate audiences at places such as GE, Google, LinkedIn, Accenture, Procter & Gamble, as well as university audiences such as Yale Law School, Harvard Business School, and Wharton.</p><p>Rubin was one of the first people asked to become a LinkedIn “Influencer,” where she has an enormous, active group of followers. She was named one of the “100 Most Influential People in Health and Fitness,” one of the Inc.’s Top 50 Leadership and Management Experts, and one of the “22 Brilliant Thinkers Everyone Should Follow on Twitter” by Business Insider.</p><p>Raised in Kansas City, she lives in New York City with her husband and two daughters.</p>",

And with simple strategies rooted in scientific research, that’s exactly what she does, empowering organizational leaders with proven tools for maximizing commitment, resisting distraction, devising effective strategic plans, seizing opportunities to act, and persisting in the face of setbacks or challenges.</p><p>Outstanding organizations, like outstanding people, reach their goals because of what they do, not just who they are, according to Dr. Grant Halvorson. An exhaustive study of achievement and motivation has led her to pinpoint the keys to mastering the art (and science) of execution — the nine things successful people do differently. They’re not rocket science, but they are proven to help people reach their goals by focusing less on past failures and more on what really matters: commitment, planning, effort, strategy, self-control and persistence.</p><p>Heidi is the author of Focus: Use Different Ways of Seeing The World for Success and Influence, co written with E. Tory Higgins, has received rave reviews from Dan Pink, Robert Cialdini, Jim Kouzes, Dan Gilbert, Chip & Dan Heath, and many others. She is also the author of the bestselling Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals and Nine Things Successful People Do Differently. Her latest book is No One Understands You and What to Do About It.</p><p>Dr. Grant Halvorson is a member of the highly selective Society for Experimental Social Psychology.

Upon completing her grueling 53 hour journey, a breathless Nyad told the world, “I have three messages. One is we should never ever give up. Two is you are never too old to chase your dreams. And three is it looks like a solitary sport, but it takes a team.” Nyad has never been one to quit. In July of 2010, at the age of 60, she began her “Xtreme Dream” quest of swimming from Cuba to Florida, a task she had failed to finish thirty years previously. When asked her motivation, she replied, “Because I’d like to prove to the other 60-year-olds that it is never too late to start your dreams.” Nyad was unsuccessful in her quest in 2010 and tried two more times 2011 and 2012 before completing the historic swim in 2013.</p><p>Back in the 1970’s, Nyad was the greatest long-distance swimmer in the world. Her world records, such as circling Manhattan Island and crossing the 102.5 miles between the Bahamas and Florida, have led to inductions to many Halls of Fame, such as the International Women’s Sports Hall of Fame.</p><p>Her book Find a Way: One Wild and Precious Life, was published in Fall 2015. She recently debuted the one-woman show, Onward! The Diana Nyad Story, in Los Angeles and Key West. Directed and adapted by Joshua Ravetch, who helped shape Carrie Fisher’s show Wishful Drinking, Onward! has received praise among the theatre community.</p>",

Then-Senator Biden served as chairman or ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 years, and was a preeminent voice on criminal justice issues, including authoring both the landmark 1994 Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act. Biden has worked relentlessly since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 to change the culture around domestic violence and sexual assault, and protect and strengthen victims’ rights.</p><p>As the 47th Vice President of the United States, Biden oversaw the implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was integral to rescuing the economy from the brink of another Great Depression. The Recovery Act added 2 million jobs to the economy and made an unprecedented investment in America’s<br />infrastructure. According to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, under former Vice President Biden’s oversight, more than $800 billion dollars were injected into the economy with less than two tenths of one percent waste, fraud or abuse—making it one of the most efficient government programs in history.</p><p>As Vice President, Biden also chaired the Middle-Class Task Force, an administration-wide effort to improve the everyday lives and livelihoods of working men and women, and oversaw the administration’s Skills Initiative to improve federal workforce training programs. He authored “Ready to Work: Job-Driven Training and American Opportunity”, a report to the president on how best to ensure American workers are trained for the jobs of the 21st century.</p><p>Biden also led the administration’s efforts to implement meaningful reforms to reduce gun violence in the U.S., which resulted in federal actions aimed at strengthening the background check system and addressing mental health issues linked to gun violence, among others.</p><p>In January, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction—the highest civilian honor in the U.S.</p><p>Biden is an alumnus of the University of Delaware, Class of 1965.</p><p>Since leaving the White House, Vice President Biden continues his legacy of expanding opportunity for all with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Biden Domestic Policy Institute at the University of Delaware.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Honourable <strong>Jody Wilson-Raybould</strong>, P.C., Q.C., was raised to be a leader. The daughter of a hereditary chief and Indigenous leader, she always knew that she would seek leadership roles and responsibilities. As a lawyer, an advocate, and a leader among Canada’s Indigenous Peoples, she’s built a strong reputation as a bridge builder and champion of good governance and accountability. She shares her unique perspective as both a community and political leader on topics such as Indigenous rights and reconciliation, democracy and governance, leadership, and justice.</p><p>Wilson-Raybould was first elected as a Member of Parliament for the new constituency of Vancouver Granville in 2015. She was then appointed the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, making her the first Indigenous person to serve in this portfolio. In January 2019, she was appointed the Minister of Veterans Affairs of Canada and Associate Minister of National Defence, positions she held until her resignation from cabinet in 2019 following the SNC-Lavalin affair.</p><p>During the 2019 election, Wilson-Raybould was re-elected as an Independent Member of Parliament for Vancouver Granville, making her Canada’s first ever female Independent MP elected and the only elected Independent in the 43rd Parliament.</p><p>Prior to politics, Wilson-Raubould was a provincial crown prosecutor in Vancouver and served three terms as an elected Commissioner of the BC Treaty Commission. She was also elected BC Regional Chief of the Assembly of First Nations in 2009, where she devoted herself to the advancement of First Nations governance, fair access to land and resources, as well as improved education and health care services. She served until 2015, holding responsibilities for governance and Nation building on the Assembly of First Nations Executive.</p><p>Wilson-Raybould is a descendant of the Musgamagw Tsawataineuk and Laich-Kwil-Tach peoples, which are part of the Kwakwaka’wakw and also known as the Kwak’wala speaking peoples. She is a member of the We Wai Kai Nation with her traditional name, Puglaas, means “woman born to noble people.” She served two terms as an elected councillor for her Nation and was also a director and chair of the First Nations Finance Authority and a director of the First Nations Lands Advisory Board.</p><p>In 2021, Wilson-Raybould released her memoir, Indian in the Cabinet: Speaking Truth to Power, which became a #1 national bestseller and was a finalist for The Writers’ Trust Balsillie Prize for Public Policy.</p><p></p>",

During his tenure in the world’s top forums such as the G-7, G-20, NATO, and the United Nations, Prime Minister Harper was known for a frank, assertive leadership style defined by principled diplomacy, disciplined economic policy, a strong stance on international peace and security, and passionate defence of freedom and human dignity.</p><p>Prime Minister Harper created the modern Conservative Party of Canada, won three successive national elections, and was the longest-serving Conservative Prime Minister since Canada’s founding Prime Minister left office in 1891. Under his watch, Canada emerged from the 2008 economic crisis faster and stronger than its peers. Among his many accomplishments in office, Prime Minister Harper brought federal taxes to their lowest level in 50 years, balanced the budget while making investments in health care and infrastructure, overhauled the criminal justice system, and expanded Canada’s international trade network tenfold.</p><p>On the international stage, Prime Minister Harper oversaw Canada’s involvement in a series of complex conflicts in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq, and stood staunchly by besieged allies Israel and Ukraine. As the host leader of the 2010 G-20 summit in Toronto, and as an economist by training, Prime Minister Harper helped shape financial reform frameworks, implemented a sustainable approach to fiscal stimulus, and led the call for open markets and pragmatic, growth-oriented economic policy.</p><p></p>",

In addition, she served as Team Canada’s flag-bearer at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games.</p><p>As the founding spokesperson for Bell Let’s Talk, a campaign designed to end the stigma attached to mental illness, Hughes helped jumpstart the conversation on mental wellness. In 2014, she completed a 110-day national bicycle tour through every province and territory in Canada called “Clara’s Big Ride”. She covered more than 11,000 kilometres, visited 105 communities, and hosted over 235 events to raise awareness for mental health. She is also the author of the bestselling memoir, Open Heart, Open Mind.</p><p>Over the course of her distinguished career, Hughes has won countless awards and accolades.
