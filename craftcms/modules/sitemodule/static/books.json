Now he tells it all in a book guaranteed to make you burst out laughing; or your money back guaranteed. In I Almost Killed George Burns!, Nulman names the names, dishes the dirt, and spews outrageously hilarious, behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the time: he came within two inches of killing George Burns; John Candy almost killed him; twice; he was almost strangled by Jerry Lewis and publicly humiliated by Roseanne; a nude man with fireworks in his butt shot Tim Allen to fame; he was reprimanded by Bea Arthur for booking an offensive act; a demonic disc jockey cost him a multi-million dollar TV contract.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pow Radical new methods for reaching jaded, cynical consumersPut simply, when it comes to your business, your new idea, even yourself, this book can be the difference between a &quot;Who cares?&quot; and a &quot;Holy cow &quot;</p>\r\n<p>Business, both big and small, is in desperate need of new ways to inspire bored and cynical consumers who have grown weary of the same old song and dance. In today&#39;s information economy, it doesn&#39;t matter how many people you reach, but how much attention they pay. And the best way to get attention is with the powerful, but largely misunderstood, element of surprise.</p>\r\n<p>Pow Enter Andy Nulman with the art of surprise marketing. An explosive new outlook, surprise marketing solidifies the bond between you and your customers like nothing else, and keeps them coming back for more by providing a continuous flow of what they never expected. &quot;Pow Right Between the Eyes&quot; reveals the secrets, theories, and tactics of surprise marketing, and wields outrageous real-world examples (and even more outrageous tools like &quot;The Lubricant to Yes&quot; and &quot;Euphoric Shock&quot;) to help expand the boundaries of the extreme and create a bigger bang for bigger profits.</p>\r\n<p>On his quest to unlock the secret of why some things knock your socks off and others put you to sleep, Nulman shares insights from director Alfred Hitchcock, designer Philippe Starck, playwright David Mamet, &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth McFarlane, Harvard psychologists, songwriters, bloggers, and even the inventor of Pirate Booty snack chips. And he shows how today&#39;s smartest companies are winning big with surprises stories like:</p>\r\n<p>- How Oprah&#39;s shocking announcement that &quot;Everybody gets a car &quot; sent her Web site traffic up 800% and helped the Pontiac G6 outsell its competitors by 20%</p>\r\n<p>- How Target earns $7 billion a year in free publicity with stunts like a floating temporary store in New York&#39;s Hudson River or putting on a vertical fashion show where acrobat models walked down the side of Rockefeller Center</p>\r\n<p>- How Bear Naked Granola reversed the trick-or-treat tradition by sending costumed street teams door-to-door to give away granola samples on Halloween</p>\r\n<p>Andy Nulman is a wildly-successful businessman and even wilder public speaker who first learned the power of surprise working with Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, and many other comedians as the cofounder and CEO of the Just For Laughs Festival, the world&#39;s largest comedy event. His book shares hilarious and effective surprise promotions that he himself dreamed up for the event and in his current position as cofounder, President, and CMO of Airborne Mobile, which brings brands like &quot;Maxim,&quot; &quot;Family Guy,&quot; and the NFL to the mobile media world.</p>\r\n<p>Don&#39;t forget to read the book&#39;s two forewords by the legendary John Cleese and CBS &quot;Late Late Show&quot; host Craig Ferguson. Surprising choices for a business book? Well...what did you expect?</p>",

    "description": "<p>There is a competitive advantage out there, arguably more powerful than any other. Is it superior strategy? Faster innovation? Smarter employees? No, New York Times best-selling author, Patrick Lencioni, argues that the seminal difference between successful companies and mediocre ones has little to do with what they know and how smart they are and more to do with how healthy they are. In this book, Lencioni brings together his vast experience and many of the themes cultivated in his other best-selling books and delivers a first: a cohesive and comprehensive exploration of the unique advantage organizational health provides. Simply put, an organization is healthy when it is whole, consistent and complete, when its management, operations and culture are unified. Healthy organizations outperform their counterparts, are free of politics and confusion and provide an environment where star performers never want to leave. Lencioni&#39;s first non-fiction book provides leaders with a groundbreaking, approachable model for achieving organizational health -- complete with stories, tips and anecdotes from his experiences consulting to some of the nation&#39;s leading organizations. In this age of informational ubiquity and nano-second change, it is no longer enough to build a competitive advantage based on intelligence alone. The Advantage provides a foundational construct for conducting business in a new way -- one that maximizes human potential and aligns the organization around a common set of principles.</p>",

Merchant gets the new reality--leadership fails not so much from flawed strategy as it does from failed processes of engagement from those responsible for implementing the strategy. In high-performing organizations, everyone acts like a leader, and they own the strategy and take actions to ensure its success.

Business strategy typically has been planned by corporate chiefs in annual meetings, and then dictated to managers to carry out. <em>The New How</em> turns that notion on its head. After many years of working with Apple, Adobe, HP, and many other companies, Nilofer Merchant discovered the secret sauce: the best way to create a winning strategy is to include employees at all levels, helping to create strategy they not only believe in, but are also equipped to implement.</p><p>\nIn <em>The New How</em>, Nilofer shows today's corporate directors, executives, and managers how they can transform their traditional, top-down approach to strategy planning and execution into collaborative \"stratecution\" that has proven to be significantly more effective.</p><p>\n<br />\nEnhance performance and outcomes by deflating the \"air sandwich\" between executives in the boardroom and employees<br />\nRecognize that strategy and execution are thoroughly intertwined<br />\nUnderstand how successful strategy is founded in effective idea selection-a pile of good ideas doesn't necessarily build good strategy<br />\nCreate company strategy and link it to targeted execution, using the practical models and techniques provided</p>",

Understanding this loop is the key to exercising regularly or becoming more productive at work or tapping into reserves of creativity. Marketers, too, are learning how to exploit these loops to boost sales; CEOs and coaches are using them to change how employees work and athletes compete.

Full of compelling narratives that will appeal to fans of Michael Lewis, Jonah Lehrer, and Chip and Dan Heath, <strong>The Power of Habit</strong> contains an exhilarating argument: our most basic actions are not the product of well-considered decision making, but of habits we often do not realize exist.

Whether you manage the smallest of teams or a multi-continent organization, you are the owner of a work culture&mdash;congratulations&mdash;and few things will have a bigger impact on your performance than getting your people to buy into your ideas and your cause and to believe what they do matters.</p>\r\n<p>Bestselling authors of <em>The Carrot Principle&nbsp;</em>and <em>The Orange Revolution,&nbsp;</em>Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton return to answer the most overlooked leadership questions of our day: Why are some managers able to get their employees to commit wholeheartedly to their culture and give that extra push that leads to outstanding results? And how can managers at any level build and sustain a profitable, vibrant work-group culture of their own?</p>\r\n<p>These leading workplace experts teamed up with research giant Towers Watson to analyze an unprecedented 300,000-person study, and they made a groundbreaking finding: managers of the highest-performing work groups create a &ldquo;culture of belief.&rdquo; In these distinctive workplaces, people <em>believe</em>in their leaders and in the company&rsquo;s vision, values, and goals. Employees are not only engaged but also enabled and energized (termed the three Es), which leads to astonishing results&mdash;average annual revenues three times higher than for organizations lacking such a positive culture. And this was true during a period that included this most recent recession.</p>\r\n<p>Based on their extensive consulting experience and in-depth interviews with leaders and employees at exceptional companies such as American Express, Cigna, Avis Budget, Pepsi Bottling, and Hard Rock, the authors present a simple seven-step road map for creating a culture of belief: define a burning platform; create a customer focus; develop agility; share everything; partner with your talent; root for each other; and establish clear accountability. Delving into specific how-tos for each step, they share eye-opening stories of exceptional leaders in action, vividly depicting just how these powerful methods can be implemented by any manager.</p>\r\n<p><em>All In</em>draws on cutting-edge psychology and all of the creative genius that have made Gostick and Elton a must-read for leaders worldwide.

The book was even adopted by the prestigious FranklinCovey International training and consulting group for its leadership training. This updated edition couldn't come at a better time, as the economic downturn requires us all to come up with creative and cost-effective ways to stimulate growth and productivity.</p><p>\nRevealing the groundbreaking results of one of the most in-depth management studies ever undertaken, <em>The Carrot Principle</em> shows definitively that the central characteristic of the most successful managers is that they provide their employees with frequent and effective recognition. With independent results from HealthStream Research, and analysis by bestselling leadership experts Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton, this breakthrough study of 200,000 people over ten years found dramatically greater business results when managers offered constructive praise and meaningful rewards in ways that powerfully motivated employees to excel.

What is the true driver of a thriving organization's exceptional success? Is it a genius leader? An iron-clad business plan? Gostick and Elton shatter these preconceptions of corporate achievement. Their research shows that breakthrough success is guided by a particular breed of high-performing team that generates its own momentum--an engaged group of colleagues in the trenches, working passionately together to pursue a shared vision. Their research also shows that only 20 percent of teams are working anywhere near this optimal capacity. How can your team become one of them?Based on a groundbreaking 350,000-person study by the Best Companies Group, as well as extraordinary research into exceptional teams at leading companies, including Zappos.com, Pepsi Beverages Company, and Madison Square Garden, the authors have determined a key set of characteristics displayed by members of breakthrough teams, and have identified a set of rules great teams live by, which generate a culture of positive teamwork and lead to extraordinary results. Using a wealth of specific stories from the breakthrough teams they studied, they reveal in detail how these teams operate and how managers can transform their own teams into such high performers by fostering: Stronger clarity of goalsGreater trust among team membersMore open and honest dialogueStronger accountability for all team membersPurpose-based recognition of team members' contributionsThe remarkable stories they tell about these teams in action provide a simple and powerful step-by-step guide to taking your team to the breakthrough level, igniting the passion and vision to bring about an Orange Revolution.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Mark Twain once observed, &ldquo;A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.&rdquo; His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health scares circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas&ndash;business people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and others&ndash;struggle to make their ideas &ldquo;stick.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In <em>Made to Stick</em>, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the &ldquo;human scale principle,&rdquo; using the &ldquo;Velcro Theory of Memory,&rdquo; and creating &ldquo;curiosity gaps.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds&ndash;from the infamous &ldquo;kidney theft ring&rdquo; hoax to a coach&rsquo;s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony&ndash;draw their power from the same six traits.</p>\r\n<p><em>Made to Stick</em>is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It&rsquo;s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures)&ndash;the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of &ldquo;the Mother Teresa Effect&rdquo;; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, <em>Made to Stick</em> shows us the vital principles of winning ideas&ndash;and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The primary obstacle is a conflict that&#39;s built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller <em>Made to Stick</em>. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems - the rational mind and the emotional mind - that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.</p>\r\n<p>In <strong>Switch</strong>, the Heaths show how everyday people - employees and managers, parents and nurses - have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:</p>\r\n<p>- The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients (see page 242)<br />\r\n- The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping (see page 130)<br />\r\n- The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by <em>removing</em> a standard tool of customer service (see page 199)</p>\r\n<p>In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. <strong>Switch</strong> shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.</p>",

It's not a question they anticipate or care much about on opening day.

Using case discussions, after-hours talks, and participants' own strategy dilemmas, she illuminates what strategy is, why it's important, and what it takes to lead the effort. En route, she equips them to confront the most essential question facing every business leader: Does this company truly matter? In doing so, she shows that strategy is not just a tool for outwitting the competition; it is the most powerful means a leader has for shaping a company itself.</p><p>\nThe Strategist exposes all business leaders--whether they run a global enterprise or a small business--to the invaluable insights Montgomery shares with these privileged executives. By distilling the experiences and insights gleaned in the classroom, Montgomery helps leaders develop the skills and sensibilities they need to become strategists themselves.

It isn&#39;t some abstract concept or wacky business strategy--it&#39;s real, and every one of us is doing business in it every day, whether we choose to recognize it or not. It&#39;s the way we communicate, the way we buy and sell, the way businesses and consumers interact online and offline. The Internet, where the Thank You Economy was born, has given consumers back their voice, and the tremendous power of their opinions via social media means that companies and brands have to compete on a whole different level than they used to.</p>\r\n<p>Gone are the days when a blizzard of marketing dollars could be used to overwhelm the airwaves, shut out the competition, and grab customer awareness. Now customers&#39; demands for authenticity, originality, creativity, honesty, and good intent have made it necessary for companies and brands to revert to a level of customer service rarely seen since our great-grandparents&#39; day, when business owners often knew their customers personally, and gave them individual attention.</p>\r\n<p>Here renowned entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk reveals how companies big and small can scale that kind of personal, one-on-one attention to their entire customer base, no matter how large, using the same social media platforms that carry consumer word of mouth. The Thank You Economy offers compelling, data-driven evidence that we have entered into an entirely new business era, one in which the companies that see the biggest returns won&#39;t be the ones that can throw the most money at an advertising campaign, but will be those that can prove they care about their customers more than anyone else. The businesses and brands that harness the word-of-mouth power from social media, those that can shift their culture to be more customer-aware and fan-friendly, will pull away from the pack and profit in today&#39;s markets.</p>\r\n<p>Filled with Vaynerchuk&#39;s irrepressible candor and wit, as well as real-world examples of companies that are profiting by putting Thank You Economy principles into practice, The Thank You Economy reveals how businesses can harness all the changes and challenges inherent in social media and turn them into tremendous opportunities for profit and growth.</p>",

Later he learned at the school of hard knocks as the head of emergency rescue operations in Canada and international task forces in eastern Europe and Afghanistan.

But leaders also act out of moral courage, take advantage of crises, accept failure and remain perpetually optimistic. Whether on the front lines of a business or in any situation that requires strong communication and vision, leaders go with their gut and make the tough decisions look easy. Leadership is an inspirational, easy-to-read and, in true Hillier fashion, often humorous collection of fifty principles that will challenge the way you run your business, start a project or take that next step in life.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Enchantment, as defined by bestselling business guru Guy Kawasaki, is not about manipulating people. It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes the skeptics and cynics into the believers and the undecided into the loyal. Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it&#39;s more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.</p>\r\n<p>Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions. For instance, enchantment is what enabled . . .<br />\r\nA Peace Corps volunteer to finesse a potentially violent confrontation with armed guerrillas. A small cable channel (E!) to win the TV broadcast rights to radio superstar Howard Stern.?? A seemingly crazy new running shoe (Vibram Five Fingers) to methodically build a passionate customer base.?? A Canadian crystal maker (Nova Scotian Crystal) to turn observers into buyers.<br />\r\nThis book explains all the tactics you need to prepare and launch an enchantment campaign; to get the most from both push and pull technologies; and to enchant your customers, your employees, and even your boss. It shows how enchantment can turn difficult decisions your way, at times when intangibles mean more than hard facts. It will help you overcome other people&#39;s entrenched habits and defy the not-always-wise &quot;wisdom of the crowd.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Kawasaki&#39;s lessons are drawn from his tenure at one of the most enchanting organizations of all time, Apple, as well as his decades of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. There are few people in the world more qualified to teach you how to enchant people.</p>\r\n<p>As Kawasaki writes, &quot;Want to change the world? Change caterpillars into butterflies? This takes more than run-of-the-mill relationships. You need to convince people to dream the same dream that you do.&quot; That&#39;s a big goal, but one that&#39;s possible for all of us.</p>",

Everyone who wants to make the world a better place becomes possessed by a grand idea.<br />\nBut what does it take to turn your idea into action?&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you are an entrepreneur, intrapreneur, or not-for-profit crusader, there&rsquo;s no shortage of advice available on issues such as writing a business plan, recruiting, raising capital, and branding. In fact, there are so many books, articles, and Web sites that many startups get bogged down to the point of paralysis. Or else they focus on the wrong priorities and go broke before they discover their mistakes.&nbsp;In <em>The Art of the Start,</em> Guy Kawasaki brings two decades of experience as one of business&rsquo;s most original and irreverent strategists to offer the essential guide for anyone starting anything, from a multinational corporation to a church group. At Apple in the 1980s, he helped lead one of the great companies of the century, turning ordinary consumers into evangelists. As founder and CEO of Garage Technology Ventures, a venture capital firm, he has field-tested his ideas with dozens of newly hatched companies. And as the author of&nbsp;bestselling business books and articles, he has advised thousands of people who are making their startup dreams real.&nbsp;From raising money to hiring the right people, from defining your positioning to creating a brand, from creating buzz to buzzing the competition, from managing a board to fostering a community, this book will guide you through an adventure that&rsquo;s more art than science&mdash;the art of the start.<br />\n</p>",

During his forty-year career at General Electric, he led the company to year-after-year success around the globe, in multiple markets, against brutal competition. His honest, be-the-best style of management became the gold standard in business, with his relentless focus on people, teamwork, and profits.</p>\r\n<p>Since Welch retired in 2001 as chairman and chief executive officer of GE, he has traveled the world, speaking to more than 250,000 people and answering their questions on dozens of wide-ranging topics.</p>\r\n<p>Inspired by his audiences and their hunger for straightforward guidance, Welch has written both a philosophical and pragmatic book, which is destined to become the bible of business for generations to come. It clearly lays out the answers to the most difficult questions people face both on and off the job.</p>\r\n<p>Welch&#39;s objective is to speak to people at every level of an organization, in companies large and small.

He explores the importance of values, candor, differentiation, and voice and dignity for all.</p>\r\n<p>The core of Winning is devoted to the real &quot;stuff&quot; of work. This main part of the book is split into three sections. The first looks inside the company, from leadership to picking winners to making change happen. The second section looks outside, at the competition, with chapters on strategy, mergers, and Six Sigma, to name just three. The next section of the book is about managing your career--from finding the right job to achieving work-life balance.</p>\r\n<p>Welch&#39;s optimistic, no excuses, get-it-done mind-set is riveting. Packed with personal anecdotes and written in Jack&#39;s distinctive no b.s. voice, Winning offers deep insights, original thinking, and solutions to nuts-and-bolts problems that will change the way people think about work.</p>",

The convergence of these emerging workplace trends has created a generation of hyperconnected workers who are placing increased pressure on employers to overhaul their approach to talent management. In &quot;The 2020 Workplace,&quot; human resources experts Jeanne C. Meister and Karie Willyerd offer a practical game plan companies can use to attract and keep these employees, and, in doing so, transform their organizations; achieve compelling business results, such as increased innovation and improved customer connectedness; and compete more effectively in the global marketplace.</p>\r\n<p>Based on key findings from two surveys of global professionals, as well as case studies from organizations such as Deloitte, Cisco, Bell Canada, JetBlue, Nokia, and NASA, this book shows how the social technologies that are used outside the company in marketing to connect with customers can be adapted for use inside the company to connect with employees. Meister and Willyerd bolster their thought-provoking research with real-world examples of these practices in action, including a YouTube new-hire orientation contest, the use of Twitter for sourcing job candidates, and a video game for new hires. With twenty predictions for the 2020 workplace and a glossary for those who have never texted, posted to Facebook, or Tweeted, this book is a must-read guide to what companies should do--and are already doing--to create tomorrow&#39;s workplace of choice.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A visionary and optimistic thinker examines the tension between privacy and publicness that is transforming how we form communities, create identities, do business, and live our lives.Thanks to the internet, we now live--more and more--in public. More than 750 million people (and half of all Americans) use Facebook, where we share a billion times a day. The collective voice of Twitter echoes instantly 100 million times daily, from Tahrir Square to the Mall of America, on subjects that range from democratic reform to unfolding natural disasters to celebrity gossip. New tools let us share our photos, videos, purchases, knowledge, friendships, locations, and lives.Yet change brings fear, and many people--nostalgic for a more homogeneous mass culture and provoked by well-meaning advocates for privacy--despair that the internet and how we share there is making us dumber, crasser, distracted, and vulnerable to threats of all kinds. But not Jeff Jarvis.In this shibboleth-destroying book, \"Public Parts \"argues persuasively and personally that the internet and our new sense of publicness are, in fact, doing the opposite. Jarvis travels back in time to show the amazing parallels of fear and resistance that met the advent of other innovations such as the camera and the printing press. The internet, he argues, will change business, society, and life as profoundly as Gutenberg's invention, shifting power from old institutions to us all.Based on extensive interviews, \"Public Parts \"introduces us to the men and women building a new industry based on sharing. Some of them have become household names--Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Eric Schmidt, and Twitter's Evan Williams. Others may soon be recognized as the industrialists, philosophers, and designers of our future. Jarvis explores the promising ways in which the internet and publicness allow us to collaborate, think, ways--how we manufacture and market, buy and sell, organize and govern, teach and learn. He also examines the necessity as well as the limits of privacy in an effort to understand and thus protect it. This new and open era has already profoundly disrupted economies, industries, laws, ethics, childhood, and many other facets of our daily lives. But the change has just begun. The shape of the future is not assured. The amazing new tools of publicness can be used to good ends and bad. The choices--and the responsibilities--lie with us. Jarvis makes an urgent case that the future of the internet--what one technologist calls \"the eighth continent\"--requires as much protection as the physical space we share, the air we breathe, and the rights we afford one another. It is a space of the public, for the public, and by the public. It needs protection and respect from all of us. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in the wake of the uprisings in the Middle East, \"If people around the world are going to come together every day online and have a safe and productive experience, we need a shared vision to guide us.\" Jeff Jarvis has that vision and will be that guide.</p>",

At the same time, he illuminates the new worldview of the internet generation: how it challenges and destroys, but also opens up vast new opportunities. His findings are counterintuitive, imaginative, practical, and above all visionary, giving readers a glimpse of how everyone and everything--from corporations to governments, nations to individuals--must evolve in the Google era.</p><p>\nAlong the way, he looks under the hood of a car designed by its drivers, ponders a worldwide university where the students design their curriculum, envisions an airline fueled by a social network, imagines the open-source restaurant, and examines a series of industries and institutions that will soon benefit from this book's central question.</p><p>\nThe result is an astonishing, mind-opening book that, in the end, is not about Google.

    "description": "<p>Do you want to get ahead in life?</p>\r\n<p>Climb the ladder to personal success?</p>\r\n<p>The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships&mdash;so that everyone wins.</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Never Eat Alone</em>, Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps&mdash;and inner mindset&mdash;he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him.</p>\r\n<p>The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington&rsquo;s corridors of power to Hollywood&rsquo;s A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain&rsquo;s 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum.</p>\r\n<p>Ferrazzi&#39;s form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with &ldquo;networking.&rdquo; He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t keep score:</strong> It&rsquo;s never simply about getting what you want. It&rsquo;s about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Ping&rdquo; constantly:</strong> The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time&mdash;not just when you need something.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Never eat alone:</strong> The dynamics of status are the same whether you&rsquo;re working at a corporation or attending a society event&mdash; &ldquo;invisibility&rdquo; is a fate worse than failure.</p>\r\n<p>In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world&rsquo;s most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama.</p>\r\n<p>Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a &ldquo;conference commando,&rdquo; and more, <em>Never Eat Alone</em> is destined to take its place alongside <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> as an inspirational classic.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In his landmark bestseller <em>The Tipping Point</em>, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in <em>Blink</em>, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. <em>Blink</em> is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren&#39;t as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Blink</em> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of &quot;blink&quot;: the election of Warren Harding; &quot;New Coke&quot;; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. <em>Blink</em> reveals that great decision makers aren&#39;t those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of &quot;thin-slicing&quot;--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.</p>",

And in revealing that hidden logic, Gladwell presents a fascinating and provocative blueprint for making the most of human potential.</p>\r\n<p>In <em>The Tipping Point</em> Gladwell changed the way we understand the world.

Ideas, behavior, messages, and products, he argues, often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.</p>\r\n<p>Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children&#39;s television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world&#39;s greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tThe greatest managers in the world seem to have little in common. They differ in sex, age, and race. They employ vastly different styles and focus on different goals. Yet despite their differences, great managers share one common trait: They do not hesitate to break virtually every rule held sacred by conventional wisdom. They do not believe that, with enough training, a person can achieve anything he sets his mind to. They do not try to help people overcome their weaknesses. They consistently disregard the golden rule. And, yes, they even play favorites. This amazing book explains why. Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman of the Gallup Organization present the remarkable findings of their massive in-depth study of great managers across a wide variety of situations. Some were in leadership positions. Others were front-line supervisors. Some were in Fortune 500 companies; others were key players in small, entrepreneurial companies. Whatever their situations, the managers who ultimately became the focus of Gallup&#39;s research were invariably those who excelled at turning each employee&#39;s talent into performance.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn today&#39;s tight labor markets, companies compete to find and keep the best employees, using pay, benefits, promotions, and training. But these well-intentioned efforts often miss the mark. The front-line manager is the key to attracting and retaining talented employees. No matter how generous its pay or how renowned its training, the company that lacks great front-line managers will suffer. Buckingham and Coffman explain how the best managers select an employee for talent rather than for skills or experience; how they set expectations for him or her -- they define the right outcomes rather than the right steps; how they motivate people -- they build on each person&#39;s unique strengths rather than trying to fix his weaknesses; and, finally, how great managers develop people -- they find the right fit for each person, not the next rung on the ladder. And perhaps most important, this research -- which initially generated thousands of different survey questions on the subject of employee opinion -- finally produced the twelve simple questions that work to distinguish the strongest departments of a company from all the rest. This book is the first to present this essential measuring stick and to prove the link between employee opinions and productivity, profit, customer satisfaction, and the rate of turnover.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are vital performance and career lessons here for managers at every level, and, best of all, the book shows you how to apply them to your own situation.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tMarcus Buckingham and Donald O Clifton&#39;s <em>Now, Discover Your Strengths</em> proposes a unique approach to managing personnel: focus on enhancing people&#39;s strengths rather than eliminating their weaknesses. Effectively managing personnel--as well as one&#39;s own behaviour--is an extraordinarily complex task that, not surprisingly, has been the subject of countless books touting what each claims is the true path to success. Following up on the coauthors&#39; popular previous book, <em>First, Break All the Rules</em>, it fully describes 34 positive personality themes the two have formulated (such as Achiever, Developer, Learner, and Maximiser) and explains how to build a &quot;strengths-based organisation&quot; by capitalising on the fact that such traits are already present among those within it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost original and potentially most revealing, however, is a Web-based interactive component that allows readers to complete a questionnaire developed by the Gallup Organisation and instantly discover their own top five inborn talents. This device provides a personalised window into the authors&#39; management philosophy which, coupled with subsequent advice, places their suggestions into the kind of practical context that&#39;s missing from most similar tomes. &quot;You can&#39;t lead a strengths revolution if you don&#39;t know how to find, name and develop your own,&quot; write Buckingham and Clifton. Their book encourages such introspection while providing knowledgeable guidance for applying its lessons. --<em>Howard Rothman</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>How much do we know about why we buy? What truly influences our decisions in today&rsquo;s message-cluttered world? An eye-grabbing advertisement, a catchy slogan, an infectious jingle? Or do our buying decisions take place below the surface, so deep within our subconscious minds, we&rsquo;re barely aware of them?</p><p>\nIn BUYOLOGY, Lindstrom presents the astonishing findings from his groundbreaking, three-year, seven-million-dollar neuromarketing study, a cutting-edge experiment that peered inside the brains of 2,000 volunteers from all around the world as they encountered various ads, logos, commercials, brands, and products. His startling results shatter much of what we have long believed about what seduces our interest and drives us to buy. Among his finding:</p><p>\n<strong>Gruesome health warnings on cigarette packages</strong> not only fail to discourage smoking, they actually make smokers want to light up.<br />\n<strong><br />\n</strong><br />\nDespite government bans, <strong>subliminal advertising still surrounds us</strong>&ndash; from bars to highway billboards to supermarket shelves. </p><p>\n\"Cool&rdquo; brands, like iPods <strong>trigger our mating instincts.</strong> </p><p>\n<strong>Other senses</strong>&ndash; smell, touch, and sound - are so powerful, they physically arouse us when we see a product. </p><p>\n<strong>Sex doesn't sell.</strong>In many cases, <strong></strong>people in skimpy clothing and suggestive poses not only fail to persuade us to buy products - they often turn us away .</p><p>\nCompanies routinetly <strong>copy from</strong> <strong>the world of</strong> <strong>religion and create rituals</strong> &ndash; like drinking a Corona with a lime &ndash; to capture our hard-earned dollars. </p><p>\nFilled with entertaining inside stories about how we respond to such well-known brands as Marlboro, Nokia, Calvin Klein, Ford, and American Idol, BUYOLOGY is a fascinating and shocking journey into the mind of today&rsquo;s consumer that will captivate anyone who&rsquo;s been seduced &ndash; or turned off &ndash; by marketers&rsquo; relentless attempts to win our loyalty, our money, and our minds.

    "description": "<p>In 1964, NBC clerk Michael Eisner made $65 a week. Though he only took one business course in his life--accounting--he did have a head for business: as CEO of Disney, he earned over half a billion bucks in 1997. Though he had no foundation in finance, he averted the bloody dismemberment of Disney by takeover sharks when he took over in 1984, and by May 1998 he earned over $80 billion for Disney stockholders. Not bad for a guy who, on his first day in Walt's old office, met a manager of the film division BVD (Buena Vista Distribution) and innocently asked whether \"Disney made underwear.\"In his memoir, Eisner doesn't air quite as much dirty laundry as we could hope he'd be dopey enough to do. Still, it is revealing, and since it's unheard-of for Hollywood potentates to spill any beans at all, this book is required reading for anyone interested in America's major export, popular culture.We learn a fair bit of personal stuff: the crucial impact of Eisner's sternly withholding father, who drove Michael to succeed and made him less than effusive himself in praising underlings; his favorite book in youth (The Catcher in the Rye); his encounters with more madcap Hollywood types; his brush with death from heart disease; the day he got the idea for Beverly Hills Cop by getting physically roughed up by a Beverly Hills cop; his plan to add the naughtier cartoon character Mortimer Mouse to Mickey's family.Eisner gives us his negotiating secret (be willing to walk), his view of prerelease audience testing of shows (\"it's almost worthless\"),his management strategy (incite raucous debate within strict institutional checks and balances, then make gut decisions), the key to success in movies and TV (strong two-man partnerships: Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg at Universal, Bob Daly and Terry Semel at Warner Bros., and preeminently Eisner and Frank Wells at Disney). Eisner gives a provocative analysis ofwhy Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Ovitz proved disastrous partners for him at Disney, and even confesses to a few screwups of his own (losing his temper and helping to blow the Disney America historical park development). --Tim Appelo</p>",

Once they learn these principles they can use them to transform their professional and personal, day-to-day, life.

Coinciding with the release of the band&#39;s spectacular photo book KISS: The Early Years (see page 44), KISS and Make-Up features four collectible covers, as well as new text from Gene and additional photos his fans have never seen before.Taking readers through &quot;KISStory&quot; and tracing the band&#39;s rise to the pinnacle of rock, KISS and Make-Up tells the story -- in Gene&#39;s irreverant and unapologetic voice -- of how an immigrant kid from Israel became an American rock icon.</p>",

A graffiti artist with no connections and no fashion pedigree, he left the safety net of pharmacy school to start his own company. Armed with only hustle, sweat equity, and creativity, he flipped a $5,000 bag of cash into a global corporation now worth $500 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Unlabel</em> is a success story, but it&rsquo;s one that shares the bruises, scabs, and gut-wrenching mistakes that every entrepreneur must overcome to succeed. Through his personal formula for success&mdash;the Authenticity Formula&mdash;Ecko recounts his many innovations and misadventures in his journey from misfit kid to the CEO. It wasn&rsquo;t a meteoric rise; in fact, it was a rollercoaster that dipped to the edge of bankruptcy and even to national notoriety, but this is an underdog story we can learn from: Ecko&rsquo;s doubling down on the core principles of the brand and his formula for action over talk are all lessons for today&rsquo;s entrepreneurs. Ecko offers a brash message with his inspirational story: embrace pain, take risks, and be yourself. <em>Unlabel&nbsp;</em>demonstrates that, like or not, you are a brand and it&rsquo;s up you to take control of it and create something authentic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Unlabel</em>is a groundbreaking guide to channeling your creativity, finding the courage to defy convention, and summoning the confidence to act and be competitive in any environment.</p>",

But this book is different. It&#39;s about you - your choices, your future, and your potential to make a huge difference in whatever field you choose.</p>\r\n<p>There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there&#39;s a third team, the linchpins. These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They figure out what to do when there&#39;s no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art.</p>\r\n<p>Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations. Like the small piece of hardware that keeps a wheel from falling off its axle, they may not be famous but they&#39;re indispensable. And in today&#39;s world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom.</p>\r\n<p>Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn&#39;t reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back. <em>Linchpin</em> will show you how to join the likes of...</p>\r\n<p>*Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill Anthropologie stores with unique pieces.<br />\r\n*Marissa Mayer, who keeps Google focused on the things that really matter.<br />\r\n*Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals without a r&eacute;sum&eacute;.<br />\r\n*David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffeeshop in New York. He sees every customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return.</p>\r\n<p>As Godin writes, &quot;Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It&#39;s time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it, and you must.&quot;</p>",

    "description": "<p>The man <em>Business Week</em> calls \"the ultimate entrepreneur for the Information Age\" explains \"Permission Marketing\" -- the groundbreaking concept that enables marketers to shape their message so that consumers will willingly accept it. Whether it is the TV commercial that breaks into our favorite program, or the telemarketing phone call that disrupts a family dinner, traditional advertising is based on the hope of snatching our attention away from whatever we are doing. Seth Godin calls this Interruption Marketing, and, as companies are discovering, it no longer works.</p><p>\nInstead of annoying potential customers by interrupting their most coveted commodity -- time -- Permission Marketing offers consumers incentives to accept advertising voluntarily. Now this Internet pioneer introduces a fundamentally different way of thinking about advertising products and services. By reaching out only to those individuals who have signaled an interest in learning more about a product, Permission Marketing enables companies to develop long-term relationships with customers, create trust, build brand awareness -- and greatly improve the chances of making a sale.</p><p>\nIn his groundbreaking book, Godin describes the four tests of Permission Marketing:</p><p>\n1. Does every single marketing effort you create encourage a learning relationship with your customers? Does it invite customers to \"raise their hands\" and start communicating?</p><p>\n2. Do you have a permission database? Do you track the number of people who have given you permission to communicate with them?</p><p>\n3. If consumers gave you permission to talk to them, would you have anything to say? Have you developed a marketing curriculum to teach people about your products?</p><p>\n4. Once people become customers, do you work to deepen your permission to communicate with those people?</p><p>\nAnd in numerous informative case studies, including American Airlines' frequent-flier program, Amazon.com, and Yahoo!, Godin demonstrates how marketers are already profiting from this key new approach in all forms of media.</p>",

There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow.&nbsp;</p><p>\nCows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows-but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period.&nbsp;</p><p>\nIn&nbsp;<em>Purple Cow</em>, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable.

    "description": "<p>In Seth Godin&rsquo;s most inspiring book yet, he challenges readers to find the courage to treat their work as a form of art.&nbsp;Everyone knows that Icarus&rsquo;s father made him wings and told him not to fly too close to the sun. But he ignored that warning and plunged to his doom. We&rsquo;ve retold this myth, and many others like it, to generations of kids. All these stories have the same lesson: Play it safe. Obey your parents. Listen to the experts.&nbsp;It was the perfect propaganda for the industrial economy. What boss wouldn&rsquo;t want employees to believe that obedience and conformity are the keys to success?&nbsp;But there&rsquo;s another part of the myth that those in power hope you&rsquo;ll forget. Icarus was also warned not to fly too low, because sea water would ruin the lift in his wings. Flying too low is even more dangerous than flying too high, because it feels deceptively safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety zone has moved. The propaganda has been exposed, and the old promises have been broken: Conformity no longer leads to comfort. But the good news is that creativity is scarce, and more valuable than ever. So is choosing to do something unpredictable and brave: make art.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Being an artist isn&rsquo;t a genetic disposition or a specific talent. It&rsquo;s an attitude we can all adopt. It&rsquo;s a hunger to seize new ground, make connections, and work without a map.&nbsp;If you do those things you&rsquo;re an artist, no matter what it says on your business card.&nbsp; Whether you&rsquo;re a teacher, engineer, doctor, middle manager, or customer service rep, you can fly higher by bringing your best self to work. You can care about what you&rsquo;re doing today and how you can improve tomorrow. Godin shows us how it&rsquo;s possible, and convinces us why it&rsquo;s essential.<br />\n</p>",

    "description": "<p>A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It?s our nature.</p><p>\nNow the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they?re enabling countless new tribes to be born?groups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming.</p><p>\nAnd so the key question: Who is going to lead us?</p><p>\nThe Web can do amazing things, but it can?t provide leadership. That still has to come from individuals? people just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips.</p><p>\nIf you think leadership is for other people, think again?leaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.</p><p>\nIf you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a ?sheepwalker??someone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don?t do very well these days.</p><p>\nTribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . It?s not easy, but it?s easier than you think.</p><p>\n</p>",

The book calls for end of mass and for the beginning of offering people more choices, more interests and giving them more authority to operate in ways that reflect their own unique values. <br />\nFor generations, marketers, industrialists and politicians have tried to force us into little boxes, complying with their idea of what we should buy, use or want. And in an industrial, mass-market driven world, this was efficient and it worked. But what we learned in this new era is that mass limits our choice because it succeeds on conformity.</p>\n<p>As Godin has identified, a new era of weirdness is upon us. People with more choices, more interests and the power to do something about it are stepping forward and insisting that the world work in a different way. By enabling choice we allow people to survive and thrive.</p>",

Organizations across the globe are competing in a world that is changing faster than ever. They say they need people who can think creatively, who are flexible and quick to adapt. Too often they say they can&#39;t find them. Why not? In this provocative and inspiring book, Ken Robinson addresses three vital questions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWhy is it essential to promote creativity? Business leaders, politicians and educators emphasize the vital importance of promoting creativity andinnovation. Why does this matter so much?</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWhat is the problem? Why do so many people think they&#39;re not creative? Young children are buzzing with ideas.

What can companies, schools and organizations do to develop creativity and innovation in a deliberate and systematic way?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this extensively revised and updated version of his bestselling classic, Out of Our Minds, Ken Robinson offers a groundbreaking approach to understanding creativity in education and in business.

Out of Our Minds is a passionate and powerful call for radically different approaches to leadership, teaching and professional development to help us all to meet the extraordinary challenges of living and working in the 21st century.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>The book that started the Quiet Revolution<br />\n</strong><br />\nAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts&mdash;Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak-- that we owe many of the great contributions to society.&nbsp;</p><p>\nIn <em>Quiet,</em>Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts&ndash;from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, <em>Quiet</em>has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.</p><p>\nNow with Extra Libris material, including a reader&rsquo;s guide and bonus content</p>",

Not so fast, says leadership visionary and bestselling author Susan Scott. In fact, these mantras &mdash; despite being long-accepted and adopted by business leaders everywhere &mdash; are completely wrongheaded. Worse, they are costing companies billions of dollars, driving away valuable employees and profitable customers, limiting performance, and stalling careers. Yet they are so deeply ingrained in organizational cultures that no one has questioned them. Until now.</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Fierce Leadership</em>, Scott teaches us how to spot the worst &ldquo;best&rdquo; practices in our organizations using a technique she calls &ldquo;squid eye&rdquo;&ndash;the ability to see the &ldquo;tells&rdquo; or signs that we have fallen prey to disastrous behaviors by knowing what to look for. Only then, she says, can we apply the antidote..</p>\r\n<p>Informed by over a decade of conversations with Fortune 500 executives, this book <em>is</em> that antidote. With fierce new approaches to everything from employee feedback to corporate diversity to customer relations, Scott offers fresh and surprising alternatives to six of the so-called &ldquo;best&rdquo; practices permeating today&rsquo;s businesses. This refreshingly candid book is a must-read for any manager or leader at any level who is ready to take a long hard look at what trouble might be lurking in their organization - and do something about it.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>From the Hardcover edition.</em></p>",

After conducting this extensive study, Rath and Harter discovered that much of what we think will improve our wellbeing is either misguided or just plain wrong. When striving to improve our lives, we're quick to buy into programs that promise to help us make money, lose weight, or strengthen our relationships. While it might be easier to treat these critical areas in our lives as if they are independent, they're not. Gallup's comprehensive study of people in more than 150 countries revealed five universal, interconnected elements that shape our lives: Career Wellbeing, Social Wellbeing, Financial Wellbeing, Physical Wellbeing, and Community Wellbeing.</p><p>\nWellbeing: The Five Essential Elements provides you with a holistic view of what contributes to your wellbeing over a lifetime. Written in a conversational style, this book is filled with fascinating research and innovative ideas for boosting your wellbeing in each of these five areas. As a complement to the book, you'll have the opportunity to use Gallup's online Wellbeing Finder to track and improve your wellbeing.

    "description": "<p><strong>A <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, Amazon Bestseller</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Reverse Innovation</strong> is the new business idea everyone is talking about. Why? Because it presents the blueprint for scaling growth in emerging markets, and importing low-cost and high impact innovations to mature ones.</p>\r\n<p>Innovation is no longer the exclusive domain of the Silicon Valley elite. <em>Reverse Innovation</em> will open your eyes to the fact that the dynamics of global innovation are changing&mdash;and if you want your firm to survive, you&rsquo;d better pay attention. The gap between rich nations and emerging economies is closing. No longer will innovations travel the globe in only one direction, from developed to developing nations. They will also flow in reverse. CEOs of the world&rsquo;s most influential companies agree and have cited <em>Reverse Innovation</em> as their playbook for the next generation of global growth.</p>\r\n<p>Authors Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth explain where, when, and why reverse innovation is on the rise and why the implications are so profound. Learn how to make innovation in emerging markets happen and how such innovations can unlock even greater opportunity throughout the world. You&rsquo;ll follow some of the world&rsquo;s leading companies (including GE, Deere &amp; Company, P&amp;G, and PepsiCo) through stories that illustrate exactly what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in a Western economy, you need to accept that the future lies far from home. But the idea is not just for Western audiences. If innovation is at the heart of your company or your career, no matter where you practice business, <em>Reverse Innovation</em> is a phenomenon you need to understand. This book will help you do that.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Among 64,000 people surveyed in thirteen nations, two-thirds feel the world would be a better place if men thought more like women. This marks a burgeoning global trend away from the winner-takes-all, masculine approach to getting things done. Drawing from interviews at innovative organizations in eighteen nations and at Fortune 500 boardrooms, the authors reveal how men and women alike are recognizing significant value in traits commonly associated with women, such as nurturing, cooperation, communication, and sharing. \"The Athena Doctrine\" shows why femininity is the operating system of 21st century prosperity: Leadership: values traditionally associated with women create more effective leadership and organizational strategies in today's society.Career management and self-improvement traits associated with women--flexibility, empathy, and honesty--underpin career mobility and personal fulfillment.Change management: feminine traits help us adapt seamlessly and effectively to today's changes.</p><p>\nBrought to life through real world portraits of women and men who lead Fortune 1000 businesses, new ventures, government and nonprofit agencies, and community groups--and backed by rigorous data--\"s\"ocial theorist John Gerzema and author Michael D'Antonio show how traditionally feminine traits are ascending and bringing success to people and organizations around the world. By nurturing, listening, collaborating and sharing, women and men are solving problems, finding profits, and redefining success in every realm.</p>",

Veteran coach and management consultant <strong>David Allen</strong> recognizes that time management is useless the minute your schedule is interrupted; setting priorities isn't relevant when your e-mail is down; procrastination solutions won't help if your goals aren't clear. Instead, Allen shares with readers the proven methods he has already introduced in seminars and at top organizations across the country. The key to Getting Things Done? Relaxation. Allen's premise is simple: our ability to be productive is directly proportional to our ability to relax. Only when our minds are clear and our thoughts are organized can we achieve stress-free productivity. His seamless system teaches us how to identify, track, and-most important-choose the next action on all our tasks, commitments, and projects and thus master all the demands on our time while unleashing our creative potential. The book's stylish, dynamic design makes it easy to follow Allen's tips, examples, and inspiration to achieve what we all seek-energy, focus, and relaxed control.</p>",

    "description": "<p>New breakthrough thinking in organizational learning, leadership, and change Continuous improvement, understanding complex systems, and promoting innovation are all part of the landscape of learning challenges today's companies face. Amy Edmondson shows that organizations thrive, or fail to thrive, based on how well the small groups within those organizations work. In most organizations, the work that produces value for customers is carried out by teams, and increasingly, by flexible team-like entities. The pace of change and the fluidity of most work structures means that it's not really about creating effective teams anymore, but instead about leading effective teaming. Teaming shows that organizations learn when the flexible, fluid collaborations they encompass are able to learn. The problem is teams, and other dynamic groups, don't learn naturally. Edmondson outlines the factors that prevent them from doing so, such as interpersonal fear, irrational beliefs about failure, groupthink, problematic power dynamics, and information hoarding. With Teaming, leaders can shape these factors by encouraging reflection, creating psychological safety, and overcoming defensive interpersonal dynamics that inhibit the sharing of ideas. Further, they can use practical management strategies to help organizations realize the benefits inherent in both success and failure. * Presents a clear explanation of practical management concepts for increasing learning capability for business results * Introduces a framework that clarifies how learning processes must be altered for different kinds of work * Explains how Collaborative Learning works, and gives tips for how to do it well * Includes case-study research on Intermountain healthcare, Prudential, GM, Toyota, IDEO, the IRS, and both Cincinnati and Minneapolis Children's Hospitals, among others Based on years of research, this book shows how leaders can make organizational learning happen by building t</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>An innovative, groundbreaking book that will captivate readers of Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Pink, <em>The Power of Habit</em>, and <em>Quiet</em></strong></p><p>\nFor generations, we have focused on the individual drivers of success: passion, hard work, talent, and luck. But today, success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. It turns out that at work, most people operate as either takers, matchers, or givers. Whereas takers strive to get as much as possible from others and matchers aim to trade evenly, givers are the rare breed of people who contribute to others without expecting anything in return.</p><p>\nUsing his own pioneering research as Wharton's youngest tenured professor, Grant shows that these styles have a surprising impact on success. Although some givers get exploited and burn out, the rest achieve extraordinary results across a wide range of industries. Combining cutting-edge evidence with captivating stories, this landmark book shows how one of America's best networkers developed his connections, why the creative genius behind one of the most popular shows in television history toiled for years in anonymity, how a basketball executive responsible for multiple draft busts transformed his franchise into a winner, and how we could have anticipated Enron's demise four years before the company collapsed-without ever looking at a single number.</p><p>\nPraised by bestselling authors such as Dan Pink, Tony Hsieh, Dan Ariely, Susan Cain, Dan Gilbert, Gretchen Rubin, Bob Sutton, David Allen, Robert Cialdini, and Seth Godin-as well as senior leaders from Google, McKinsey, Merck, Estee Lauder, Nike, and NASA-<em>Give and Take</em> highlights what effective networking, collaboration, influence, negotiation, and leadership skills have in common. This landmark book opens up an approach to success that has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organizations and communities.</p>",

People don&rsquo;t listen to advertisements, they listen to their peers. But why do people talk about certain products and ideas more than others? Why are some stories and rumors more infectious? And what makes online content go viral?</p><p>\n</p><p>\nWharton marketing professor Jonah Berger has spent the last decade answering these questions. He&rsquo;s studied why <em>New York Times</em>articles make the paper&rsquo;s own Most E-mailed List, why products get word of mouth, and how social influence shapes everything from the cars we buy to the clothes we wear to the names we give our children. In this book, Berger reveals the secret science behind word-of-mouth and social transmission. Discover how six basic principles drive all sorts of things to become contagious, from consumer products and policy initiatives to workplace rumors and YouTube videos.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<em>Contagious</em>combines groundbreaking research with powerful stories. Learn how a luxury steakhouse found popularity through the lowly cheese-steak, why anti-drug commercials might have actually increased drug use, and why more than 200 million consumers shared a video about one of the seemingly most boring products there is: a blender. If you&rsquo;ve wondered why certain stories get shared, e-mails get forwarded, or videos go viral, <em>Contagious</em>explains why, and shows how to leverage these concepts to craft contagious content. This book provides a set of specific, actionable techniques for helping information spread&mdash;for designing messages, advertisements, and information that people will share. Whether you&rsquo;re a manager at a big company, a small business owner trying to boost awareness, a politician running for office, or a health official trying to get the word out, <em>Contagious</em>will show you how to make your product or idea catch on.<strong></strong></p>",

Bill Bryson&rsquo;s <em>A Walk in</em> <em>the Woods</em> is one example. Richard Feynman&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&rdquo;</em> is another.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nNow comes Youngme Moon&rsquo;s <em>Different,</em>a book <em></em>for &ldquo;people who don&rsquo;t read business books.&rdquo; Actually, it&rsquo;s more like a personal conversation with a friend who has thought deeply about how the world works &hellip; and who gets you to see that world in a completely new light. <br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIf there is one strain of conventional wisdom pervading every company in every industry, it&rsquo;s the absolute importance of &ldquo;competing like crazy.&rdquo; Youngme Moon&rsquo;s message is simply &ldquo;Get off this treadmill that&rsquo;s taking you nowhere. Going tit for tat and adding features, augmentations, and gimmicks to beat the competition has the perverse result of making you like everyone else.&rdquo; <em>Different</em> provides a highly original perspective on what it means to offer something that is <em>meaningfully</em> different&mdash;different in a manner that is both fundamental and comprehensive. <br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYoungme Moon identifies the outliers, the mavericks, the iconoclasts&mdash;the players who have thoughtfully rejected orthodoxy in favor of an approach that is more adventurous. Some are even &ldquo;hostile,&rdquo; almost daring you to buy what they are selling. The MINI Cooper was launched with fearless abandon: &ldquo;Worried that this car is too small? Look here. It&rsquo;s even smaller than you think.&rdquo; <br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThese are players that strike a genuine chord with even the most jaded consumers. In fact, almost every success story of the past two decades has been an exception to the rule. Simply go to your computer and compare AOL and Yahoo! with Google. The former pile on feature upon feature to their home pages, while Google is like an austere boutique, dominating a category filled with &ldquo;extras.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<em>Different</em> shows how to succeed in a world where conformity reigns&hellip;but exceptions rule.</p><p>\n<br />\n<em>From the Hardcover edition.</em></p>",

At its heart are Powell's \"Thirteen Rules\"&mdash;notes he gathered over the years and that now form the basis of his leadership presentations given throughout the world. Powell's short but sweet rules&mdash;among them, \"Get mad, then get over it\" and \"Share credit\"&mdash;are illustrated by revealing personal stories that introduce and expand upon his principles for effective leadership: conviction, hard work, and, above all, respect for others. In work and in life, Powell writes, \"it's about how we touch and are touched by the people we meet. It's all about the people.\"</p><p>\nA natural storyteller, Powell offers warm and engaging parables with wise advice on succeeding in the workplace and beyond. \"Trust your people,\" he counsels as he delegates presidential briefing responsibilities to two junior State Department desk officers. \"Do your best&mdash;someone is watching,\" he advises those just starting out, recalling his own teenage summer job mopping floors in a soda-bottling factory.</p><p>\nPowell combines the insights he has gained serving in the top ranks of the military and in four presidential administrations with the lessons he's learned from his immigrant-family upbringing in the Bronx, his training in the ROTC, and his growth as an Army officer. The result is a powerful portrait of a leader who is reflective, self-effacing, and grateful for the contributions of everyone he works with.</p><p>\nColin Powell's It Worked for Me is bound to inspire, move, and surprise readers. Thoughtful and revealing, it is a brilliant and original blueprint for leadership.</p>",

AN ENDEARING AND WELL-WRITTEN BOOK.\"<br />\n--The New York Times Book Review<br />\nColin Powell is the embodiment of the American dream. He was born in Harlem to immigrant parents from Jamaica. He knew the rough life of the streets. He overcame a barely average start at school. Then he joined the Army. The rest is history--Vietnam, the Pentagon, Panama, Desert Storm--but a history that until now has been known only on the surface. Here, for the first time, Colin Powell himself tells us how it happened, in a memoir distinguished by a heartfelt love of country and family, warm good humor, and a soldier's directness. <br />\nMY AMERICAN JOURNEY is the powerful story of a life well lived and well told. It is also a view from the mountaintop of the political landscape of America. At a time when Americans feel disenchanted with their leaders, General Powell's passionate views on family, personal responsibility, and, in his own words, \"the greatness of America and the opportunities it offers\" inspire hope and present a blueprint for the future. An utterly absorbing account, it is history with a vision.<br />\n\"The stirring, only-in-America story of one determined man's journey from the South Bronx to directing the mightiest of military forces . . .

Whether you are a political junkie, a military buff, or just interested in a good story, MY AMERICAN JOURNEY is a book well worth reading.\"<br />\n--San Diego Union Tribune<br />\n\"Colin Powell's candid, introspective autobiography is a joy for all with an appetite for well-written political and social commentary.\"<br />\n--The Detroit News</p><p>\n<br />\n<em>From the Paperback edition.</em></p>",

Now, in his first book, Chris offers readers extraordinary stories from his life as an astronaut, and shows how to make the impossible a reality.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nChris Hadfield decided to become an astronaut after watching the Apollo moon landing with his family on Stag Island, Ontario, when he was nine years old, and it was impossible for Canadians to be astronauts. In 2013, he served as Commander of the International Space Station orbiting the Earth during a five-month mission. Fulfilling this lifelong dream required intense focus, natural ability and a singular commitment to &ldquo;thinking like an astronaut.&rdquo; In <em>An Astronaut&rsquo;s Guide to Life on Earth</em>, Chris gives us a rare insider&rsquo;s perspective on just what that kind of thinking involves, and how earthbound humans can use it to achieve success and happiness in their lives.<br />\nAstronaut training turns popular wisdom about how to be successful on its head. Instead of visualizing victory, astronauts prepare for the worst; always sweat the small stuff; and do care what others think. Chris shows how this unique education comes into play with dramatic anecdotes about going blind during a spacewalk, getting rid of a live snake while piloting a plane, and docking with space station Mir when laser tracking systems fail at the critical moment. Along the way, he shares exhilarating experiences, and challenges, from his 144 days on the ISS, and provides an unforgettable answer to his most-asked question: What&rsquo;s it <em>really</em>like in outer space?<br />\nWritten with humour, humility and a profound optimism for the future of space exploration, <em>An Astronaut&rsquo;s Guide to Life on Earth</em>offers readers not just the inspiring story of one man&rsquo;s journey to the ISS, but the opportunity to step into his space-boots and think like an astronaut&mdash;and renew their commitment to pursuing their own dreams, big or small.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Jonathan Fields knows the risks-and potential power-of uncertainty. He gave up a six-figure income as a lawyer to make $12 an hour as a personal trainer. Then, married with a 3-month old baby, he signed a lease to launch a yoga center in the heart of New York City. . . the day before 9/11. But he survived, and along the way he developed a fresh approach to transforming uncertainty, risk of loss, and exposure to judgment into catalysts for innovation, creation, and achievement.</p>\n<p>Properly understood and harnessed, fear and uncertainty can become fuel for creative genius rather than sources of pain, anxiety, and suffering. In business, art, and life, creating on a world-class level demands bold action and leaps of faith in the face of great uncertainty. But that uncertainty can lead to fear, anxiety, paralysis, and destruction. It can gut creativity and stifle innovation. It can keep you from taking the risks necessary to do great work and craft a deeply-rewarding life. And it can bring companies that rely on innovation grinding to a halt.</p>\n<p>That is, unless you know how to use it to your advantage. <br />\nFields draws on leading-edge technology, cognitive-science and ancient awareness-focusing techniques in a fresh, practical, non-dogmatic way. His approach enables creativity and productivity on an entirely different level and can turn the once-tortuous journey into a more enjoyable quest. Fields will reveal how to: <br />\n* Make changes to your workflow that unlock buried creative potential. <br />\n* Build \"creation hives\" -- supportive groups that can supercharge and humanize the process. <br />\n* Tap social technology and user co-creation to add clarity, certainty, and sanity, even if you're an artist or solo-creator. <br />\n* Develop a set of personal practices and mindset shifts that let you not just tolerate, but invite and even amplify, uncertainty as a catalyst for genius.</p>\n<p>Drawing on extensive case studies and research, Fields shares a set of detailed personal practices and environmental changes that can not only humanize the creative process, but also allow individuals and teams to stay more open to opportunity and play a bigger creative game.</p>",

People trust the recommendation of a friend, family member, colleague, or even stranger with similar tastes over anything thrust at them by a faceless company.</p><p>\nMost business owners believe that whether customers refer them is entirely out of their hands. But science shows that people can't help recommending products and services to their friends-it's an instinct wired deep in the brain. And smart businesses can tap into that hardwired desire.</p><p>\nMarketing expert John Jantsch offers practical techniques for harnessing the power of referrals to ensure a steady flow of new customers. Keep those customers happy, and they will refer your business to even more customers. Some of Jantsch's strategies include:</p><p>\n-<strong>Talk with your customers, not at them.</strong> Thanks to social networking sites, companies of any size have the opportunity to engage with their customers on their home turf as never before-but the key is listening.</p><p>\n-<strong>The sales team is the most important part of your marketing team.</strong> Salespeople are the company's main link to customers, who are the main source of referrals. Getting them on board with your referral strategy is critical.</p><p>\n-<strong>Educate your customers.</strong> Referrals are only helpful if they're given to the right people. Educate your customers about whom they should be talking to.</p><p>\nThe secret to generating referrals lies in understanding the \"Customer Referral Cycle\"-the way customers refer others to your company who, in turn, generate even more referrals. Businesses can ensure a healthy referral cycle by moving customers and prospects along the path of Know, Like, Trust, Try, Buy, Repeat, and Refer. If everyone in an organization keeps this sequence in mind, Jantsch argues, your business will generate referrals like a well-oiled machine.</p><p>\nThis practical, smart, and original guide is essential reading for any company looking to grow without a fat marketing budget.</p><p>\n</p>",

For many years, Wilson pursued business with uncompromising focus, working long hours, seven days a week. In the process, his marriage and his health suffered greatly: he was rarely home as his children were growing up, divorce became inevitable and cancer struck at age forty-three. He truly learned the hard way that one can find financial success and the respect of business peers while almost losing what matters most: health, family and friends.</p>\r\n<p><em>Redefining Success</em> details how Wilson was forced to redefine his life, making health and key relationships his first priorities. Through trial and error, he discovered that these simple virtues are foundational for real, enduring success, both in business and in life. Wilson&#39;s compelling insights are the basis for <em>Redefining Success</em>.

The authors&#39; study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one-the Challenger- delivers consistently high performance.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer&#39;s specific needs and objectives. Rather than acquiescing to the customer&#39;s every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale.</p>\r\n<p>The things that make Challengers unique are replicable and teachable to the average sales rep. Once you understand how to identify the Challengers in your organization, you can model their approach and embed it throughout your sales force. The authors explain how almost any average-performing rep, once equipped with the right tools, can successfully reframe customers&#39; expectations and deliver a distinctive purchase experience that drives higher levels of customer loyalty and, ultimately, greater growth.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Networking doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be that frenzied old-school game of calendars packed with stuffy power lunches and sterile evenings at community business gatherings. We&amp;#8217;ve entered a new era, one in which shifting cultural values and the explosion of digital technology enable us to network in vastly more efficient, more focused, and more enjoyable ways. </p><p>\nA fresh take on How to Win Friends and Influence People, Your Network Is Your Net Worth is an entertaining, straightforward guide filled with revealing case studies, hands-on advice, and innovative strategies for building your network. Written by sought-after speaker, entrepreneur, and marketing executive Porter Gale, with a foreword by Apple evangelist and bestselling author Guy Kawasaki, this book shows you how to establish, expand, and nurture your connections both online and off. </p><p>\nNew ways to network are popping up every day&amp;#8212;and Gale tells you how to make the most of them&amp;#8212;but even traditional networking opportunities are not the same animals that they once were, and we need to shift our attitudes and approaches accordingly. Networking has evolved from a transactional game to a transformational process. Whereas once it was about power plays, now it&amp;#8217;s about charting your own course, following your passions, and making meaningful connections, which in turn increase your happiness and productivity. </p><p>\nIn addition to chronicling her own rise from an ad agency intern to an in-demand consultant, Gale also shares the inspiring stories of so many others who live by this networking model: a military wife who connects with social media communities while her husband is deployed overseas, a young woman blog-ger battling leukemia, a dyslexic politician who wins elections by telling stories, and the CEO of a Major League Baseball team who once made a phone call that changed the course of his life. When you focus on your passions and reorganize your networking around your values and beliefs, you will discover the kind of lasting relationships, personal transformation, and, ultimately, tangible wealth that are the foundation for happiness and success. With a message both timely and important, Your Network Is Your Net Worth is the definitive handbook to Networking 2.0.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Everyone knows that the best&nbsp;way to create customer loyalty is&nbsp;with service so good, so over the&nbsp;top, that it surprises and delights.&nbsp;<em>But what if everyone is wrong?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>In their acclaimed bestseller <em>The Challenger Sale</em>,&nbsp;Matthew Dixon and his colleagues at CEB busted&nbsp;many longstanding myths about sales. Now they&rsquo;ve turned their research and analysis to a new vital&nbsp;business subject&mdash;customer loyalty&mdash;with a new book that turns the conventional wisdom on its head.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The idea that companies must delight customers&nbsp;by exceeding service expectations is so entrenched&nbsp;that managers rarely even question it. They devote&nbsp;untold time, energy, and resources to trying to&nbsp;dazzle people and inspire their undying loyalty. Yet&nbsp;CEB&rsquo;s careful research over five years and tens of&nbsp;thousands of respondents proves that the �dazzle&nbsp;factor&rdquo; is wildly overrated&mdash;it simply doesn&rsquo;t predict&nbsp;repeat sales, share of wallet, or positive wordof-mouth. The reality:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Loyalty is driven by how well a company delivers&nbsp;</em><em>on its basic promises and solves day-to-day problems,&nbsp;not on how spectacular its service experience might&nbsp;be. <strong>Most customers don&rsquo;t want to be �wowed&rdquo;; they&nbsp;</strong><strong>want an effortless experience.</strong>And they are far more&nbsp;likely to punish you for bad service than to reward&nbsp;you for good service.</em></p>\r\n<p>If you put on your customer hat rather than your&nbsp;manager or marketer hat, this makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;What do you really want from your cable company,&nbsp;a free month of HBO when it screws up or a fast,&nbsp;painless restoration of your connection? What&nbsp;about your bank&mdash;do you want free cookies and a&nbsp;cheerful smile, even a personal relationship with&nbsp;your teller? Or just a quick in-and-out transaction&nbsp;and an easy way to get a refund when it accidentally&nbsp;overcharges on fees?<br />\r\n<em>The Effortless Experience</em> takes readers on a&nbsp;fascinating journey deep inside the customer experience&nbsp;to reveal what really makes customers&nbsp;loyal&mdash;and disloyal. The authors lay out the four&nbsp;key pillars of a low-effort customer experience,&nbsp;along the way delivering robust data, shocking insights&nbsp;and profiles of companies that are already&nbsp;using the principles revealed by CEB&rsquo;s research,&nbsp;with great results. And they include&nbsp;many tools and&nbsp;templates you can start applying right away to&nbsp;improve service, reduce costs, decrease customer&nbsp;churn, and ultimately generate the elusive loyalty&nbsp;that the �dazzle factor&rdquo; fails to deliver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The rewards are there for the taking, and the&nbsp;pathway to achieving them is now clearly marked.</p>",

Powerful as words are, we fool ourselves when we think our words alone can detect, describe, and defuse the multifaceted problems of today.

This technique combines our verbal and visual minds so that we can think and learn more quickly, teach and inspire our colleagues, and enjoy and share ideas in a whole new way.</p><p>\n<strong>The Destination:</strong> No more blah-blah-blah. Through Vivid Thinking, we can make the most complicated subjects suddenly crystal clear. Whether trying to understand a Harvard Business School class, or what went down in the Conan versus Leno battle for late-night TV, or what Einstein thought about relativity, Vivid Thinking provides a way to clarify anything.</p><p>\nThrough dozens of guided examples, Roam proves that anyone can apply this systematic approach, from leftbrain types who hate to draw to right-brainers who hate to write.

With four Olympic medals (three gold and one silver) she is the heart and soul of the Canadian team. Now thirty-one, Wickenheiser has been on the national team since she was fifteen and has played more games in international competition and has more goals, assists, and penalties than any other woman in the game. She&#39;s also held her own while playing professional hockey on men&#39;s teams in Sweden and Finland. In 2008 Sports Illustrated ranked Wickenheiser as Number 20 on a list of the Top 25 Toughest Athletes in the World. In <em>Gold Medal Diary</em>, Wickenheiser reveals her day-to-day experience of the 2010 Games, including the six-month lead-up of intensive training and pre-Olympic tournaments. The heart of this book, though, is what Wickenheiser reveals about the life of an Olympian-the behind-thescenes stories, the highs and lows, physical and emotional challenges, struggles and triumphs of an elite athlete in a hyperintense environment, including details of the public ceremonies and private moments, friendships and rivalries, community and isolation, media presence and security. For the first time ever, non-Olympic athletes can be on the ground inside the storied Athletes&#39; Village and understand what it&#39;s like to live through the most high-pressure, high-profile sporting event in the world.</p>",

    "description": "<p>You are not alone. Finally, here is a book that gets to the heart of what professional women want. You've probably been loath to admit it, but like most of us, you have had enough of the sixty-hour workweeks, the day-care dash, and the vacations that never get taken. You don't want to quit, you want to work&mdash;but on your own terms and in ways that make it possible to have a life as well.</p><p>\nWomen have power. In <em>Womenomics</em>, journalists Shipman and Kay deal in facts, not stereotypes, providing a fresh perspective on the largely hidden power that women have in today's marketplace. Why? Companies with more women managers are more profitable. Women do more of the buying. A talent shortage looms. Younger generations want to work flexibly, too. It all adds up to a workplace revolution that is great news for professional women&mdash;not to mention men and businesses as well. As Brenda Barnes, CEO of Sara Lee, notes: &ldquo;Companies need to recognize that this kind of flexibility offers employees the ability to manage and balance their own careers and lives, which in turn improves productivity and employee morale.&rdquo; This new way of thinking and working is all the more valuable in a recession, as companies begin offering flexible schedules, four-day workweeks, and extended vacations as a way to avoid layoffs, save costs, and still reward employees.</p><p>\nIt is personal. <em>Womenomics</em> does more than marshal the evidence of this historic shift. It also shows women how to redefine success, be productive, and build satisfying careers that don't require an all-or-nothing lifestyle. Most appealing are the candid personal anecdotes from Shipman's and Kay's own experiences and the stories they have gathered from professional women around the country who are coping with the same issues.</p><p>\nIt is possible. Shipman and Kay don't waste time on what women can't do or can't have. Instead, they show women how to chart an empowering, exhilarating course to a richer life. Inspiring, practical, and persuasive, <em>Womenomics</em> offers a groundbreaking blueprint for changing the way you live and work&mdash;with advice, guidance, and fact-based support that proves you don't have to do it all to have it all.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>An expert on managing yourself for high performance presents a proven approach for getting more of what you want, improving your relationships, and enjoying life's deeper rewards, revealing how winning at work and in life begins by learning how to negotiate with yourself</strong></p><p>\nLife is a series of negotiations, whether or not you think of yourself as a negotiator. From seemingly insignificant daily decisions to major life choices, you negotiate every time you aim to persuade, argue over a decision, or resolve a conflict. But as negotiations and leadership expert Erica Ariel Fox reveals, the most important negotiations-the ones that determine the impact of our actions and the quality of our lives-are those we have with ourselves.</p><p>\nMost of us recognize the difference between our knowledge-what we know we should do and say-and our know-how-what we actually do and say in real life when it counts. Fox calls this the \"Performance Gap,\" and she shows you how to close it, turning breakdowns into breakthroughs, whether struggling with a difficult client, arguing with a combative teenager, or organizing for community action.</p><p>\nWinning from Within combines insights from Western psychology and Eastern philosophy with practical applications from real business situations and everyday life. Fox shows that the ability to achieve mastery over how we interact with each other comes from within, from the \"center\" where desires, thoughts, feelings, and impulses to take action live side-by-side. Winning from Within offers a profound and highly practical seven-step method for making changes that last-at work and at home. As Erica Ariel Fox demonstrates, we can actually get what we want-and feel good about the result.</p>",

The millions of us who followed Chris's Twitter feed from the ISS thought we knew what we were looking at when we saw his photos. This photo documentary shows us we didn't. We caught the beauty but missed the meaning. Curated from images never before shared, Chris's big picture reveals why our planet looks the way it does and why we live where we do. Chris sees more in these images than we do, not just because he's spent months in space but because his in-depth knowledge of geology, geography and meteorology allows him to read the mysteries the photos reveal.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divided by continent, <em>You Are Here</em> represents one (idealized) orbit of the ISS.

Or making the right investments. Or breaking down organizational silos. All of these things may help&mdash;but there&rsquo;s only one way to ensure sustained innovation: you need to <em>lead</em> it&mdash;and with a special kind of leadership. <em>Collective Genius</em> shows you how. </p><p>\nPreeminent leadership scholar Linda Hill, along with former Pixar tech wizard Greg Brandeau, MIT researcher Emily Truelove, and <em>Being the Boss</em> coauthor Kent Lineback, found among leaders a widely shared, and mistaken, assumption: that a &ldquo;good&rdquo; leader in all other respects would also be an effective leader of innovation. The truth is, leading innovation takes a distinctive kind of leadership, one that unleashes and harnesses the &ldquo;collective genius&rdquo; of the people in the organization.</p><p>\nUsing vivid stories of individual leaders at companies like Volkswagen, Google, eBay, and Pfizer, as well as nonprofits and international government agencies, the authors show how successful leaders of innovation don&rsquo;t create a vision and try to make innovation happen themselves. Rather, they create and sustain a culture where innovation is allowed to happen again and again&mdash;an environment where people are both <em>willing</em> and <em>able</em> to do the hard work that innovative problem solving requires.</p><p>\n<em>Collective Genius</em> will not only inspire you; it will give you the concrete, practical guidance you need to build innovation into the fabric of your business.<br />\n</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Bestselling author Daniel Goleman returns with a groundbreaking look at today&#39;s scarcest resource and the secret to high performance and fulfillment: attention</strong></p>\r\n<p>For more than two decades, psychologist and journalist Daniel Goleman has been scouting the leading edge of the human sciences for what&#39;s new, surprising, and important. In Focus, he delves into the science of attention in all its varieties, presenting a long overdue discussion of this little-noticed and under-rated mental asset that matters enormously for how we navigate life. Attention works much like a muscle: use it poorly and it can wither; work it well and it grows. In an era of unstoppable distractions, Goleman persuasively argues that now more than ever we must learn to sharpen focus if we are to contend with, let alone thrive, in a complex world.</p>\r\n<p>Goleman boils down attention research into a threesome: inner, other, and outer focus. A well-lived life demands we be nimble at each. Goleman shows why high-achievers need all three kinds of focus, as demonstrated by rich case studies from fields as diverse as competitive sports, education, the arts, and business. Those who excel rely on what he calls Smart Practices such as mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery, positive emotions and connections, and mental &quot;prosthetics&quot; that help them improve habits, add new skills, and sustain excellence. Combining cutting-edge research with practical findings, Focus reveals what distinguishes experts from amateurs and stars from average performers. Ultimately, Focus calls upon readers not only to pay attention to what matters most to them personally, but also to turn their attention to the pressing problems of the wider world, to the powerless and the poor, and to the future, not just to the seductively simple demands of here-and-now.</p>",

The single most important factor in job performance and advancement is <em>emotional intelligence.</em> Emotional intelligence is actually a set of skills that anyone can acquire, and in this practical guide, Daniel Goleman identifies them, explains their importance, and shows how they can be fostered.</p><p>\nFor leaders, emotional intelligence is almost 90 percent of what sets stars apart from the mediocre. As Goleman documents, it's the essential ingredient for reaching and staying at the top in any field, even in high-tech careers. And organizations that learn to operate in emotionally intelligent ways are the companies that will remain vital and dynamic in the competitive marketplace of today&mdash;and the future.</p><p>\nComprehensively researched, crisply written, and packed with fascinating case histories of triumphs, disasters, and dramatic turnarounds, <strong>Working with Emotional Intelligence</strong> may be the most important business book you'll ever read.</p><p>\nDrawing on unparalleled access to business leaders around the world and studies in more than 500 organizations, Goleman documents an astonishing fact: in determining star performance in every field, emotional intelligence matters twice as much as IQ or technical expertise.</p><p>\nReaders also discover how emotional competence can be learned. Goleman analyzes five key sets of skills and vividly shows how they determine who is hired and who is fired in the top corporations in the world. He also provides guidelines for training in the \"emotionally intelligent organization,\" in chapters that no one, from manager to CEO, should miss. </p><p>\n<strong>Working with Emotional Intelligence</strong> could prove to be the most important reference for bottom-line businesspeople in the first decades of the 21st century.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In Scaling Up Excellence, bestselling author Robert Sutton and Stanford colleague Huggy Rao tackle a challenge that determines every organization&rsquo;s success: scaling up farther, faster, and more effectively as a program or an organization creates a larger footprint. Sutton and Rao have devoted much of the last decade to uncovering what it takes to build and uncover pockets of exemplary performance, to help spread them, and to keep recharging organizations with ever better work practices. Drawing on inside accounts and case studies and academic research from a wealth of industries &ndash; including start-ups, pharmaceuticals, airlines, retail, financial services, high-tech, education, non-profits, government, and healthcare -- Sutton and Rao identify the key scaling challenges that confront every organization. They tackle the difficult trade-offs that organizations must make between &ldquo;Buddhism&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Catholicism&rdquo; -- whether to encourage individualized approaches tailored to local needs or to replicate the same practices and customs as an organization or program expands. They reveal how the best leaders and teams develop, spread, and instill the right mindsets in their people -- rather than ruining or watering down the very things that have fueled successful growth in the past. They unpack the principles that help to cascade excellence throughout an organization, as well as show how to eliminate destructive beliefs and behaviors that will hold them back. </p><p>\nScaling Up Excellence is the first major business book devoted to this universal and vexing challenge. It is destined to become the standard bearer in the field.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Now with a new chapter that focuses on what great bosses really do. Dr. Sutton reveals new insights that he&#39;s learned since the writing of Good Boss, Bad Boss. Sutton adds revelatory thoughts about such legendary bosses as Ed Catmull, Steve Jobs, A.G. Lafley, and many more, and how you can implement their techniques.<br />\r\nIf you are a boss who wants to do great work, what can you do about it? <em>Good Boss, Bad Boss</em> is devoted to answering that question. Stanford Professor Robert Sutton weaves together the best psychological and management research with compelling stories and cases to reveal the mindset and moves of the best (and worst) bosses. This book was inspired by the deluge of emails, research, phone calls, and conversations that Dr. Sutton experienced after publishing his blockbuster bestseller <em>The No Asshole Rule.</em> He realized that most of these stories and studies swirled around a central figure in every workplace: THE BOSS. These heart-breaking, inspiring, and sometimes funny stories taught Sutton that most bosses - and their followers - wanted a lot more than just a jerk-free workplace. They aspired to become (or work for) an all-around great boss, somebody with the skill and grit to inspire superior work, commitment, and dignity among their charges.<br />\r\nAs Dr. Sutton digs into the nitty-gritty of what the best (and worst) bosses do, a theme runs throughout <em>Good Boss, Bad Boss</em> - which brings together the diverse lessons and is a hallmark of great bosses: <em>They work doggedly to &quot;stay in tune&quot; with how their followers (and superiors, peers, and customers too) react to what they say and do</em><strong>.</strong> The best bosses are acutely aware that their success depends on having the self-awareness to control their moods and moves, to accurately interpret their impact on others, and to make adjustments on the fly that continuously spark effort, dignity, and pride among their people.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong> was an international phenomenon, appearing on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for over a year and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are &ldquo;wired to connect&rdquo; and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.</p><p>\nFar more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies&mdash;down to the level of our genes&mdash;for good or ill. In <strong>Social Intelligence</strong>, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a &ldquo;neural ballet&rdquo; that connects us brain to brain with those around us.</p><p>\nOur reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitamins&mdash;and bad relationships like poisons. We can &ldquo;catch&rdquo; other people&rsquo;s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for &ldquo;mindsight,&rdquo; as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.</p><p>\nIs there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? </p><p>\nThe answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought. And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruism&ndash;provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.</p>",

It is a transition many fail to make. This book traces the experiences of nineteen new managers over the course of their first year in a managerial capacity. Reveals the complexity of the transition and analyzes the expectations of the managers, their subordinates, and their superiors. New managers describe how they reframed their understanding of their roles and responsibilities, how they learned to build effective work relationships, how and when they used individual and organizational resources, and how they learned to cope with the inevitable stresses of the transformation. They describe what it was like to take on a new identity. Two themes emerge: first the transition from individual contributor to manager is a profound psychological adjustment--a transformation; second, the process of becoming a manager is primarily one of learning from experience. Through trial and error, observation and interpretation, the new managers learned what it took to become effective business leaders.</p>",

Even companies committed to jabbing-patiently engaging with customers to build the relationships so crucial to successful social media campaigns-still yearn to land the powerful, bruising swing that will knock out their opponent or their customer's resistance in one tooth-spritzing, killer blow.

    "description": "<p>The woman next to you in the coffee shop, typing madly on her laptop, just might be determining the ending to next year's block-buster film or how quickly the hottest new PDA hits store shelves. In homes, dorm rooms, waiting rooms, planes and trains around the world, millions of people are exercising enormous influence on what we buy, even though they have no official connection to those products and services. Who are they? What motivates them? Marketing experts Jackie Huba and Ben McConnell explore the ramifications of social media in Citizen Marketers. As everyday people increasingly create content on behalf of companies, brands or products, they are collaborating with others just like themselves and forming ever-growing communities of enthusiasts and evangelists. From the rough to the sophisticated, the \"user-generated media\" of blogs, online bulletin boards, podcasts, photos, songs, and animations are influencing companies' customer relationships, product design, and marketing campaigns, whether they participate willingly or not.</p>",

Hunter-Gatherer: Rookies seek out experts and return with ideas and resources to address the challenges they face.

The first type drain intelligence, energy, and capability from the ones around them and always need to be the smartest ones in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, lightbulbs go off over people's heads, ideas flow, and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now, when leaders are expected to do more with less.</p><p>\nIn this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman and management consultant Greg McKeown explore these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizations&mdash;getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation.</p><p>\nIn analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman and McKeown have identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone can learn to use&mdash;even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager. Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness all the energy and intelligence around you. <em>Multipliers</em> will show you how.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>The first book to explain the new science of self-control and how it can be harnessed to improve our health, happiness, and productivity.</strong>After years of watching her students struggling with their choices, health psychologist Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D., realized that much of what people believe about willpower is actually sabotaging their success. Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called \"The Science of Willpower\" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful <em>Psychology Today</em> blog with the same name.</p><p>\nInformed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:</p><p>\n<br />\nWillpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are healthier, happier, have more satisfying relationships, and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.</p><p>\nIn the groundbreaking tradition of <em>Getting Things Done, The Willpower Instinct</em> combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting, from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.</p>",

Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life.&nbsp;It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSo if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: <em>How do we change our habits</em>?<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Better than Before</em> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits&mdash;and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin&rsquo;s compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <em>Better than Before</em> explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlong the way, Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers readers&rsquo; most pressing questions&mdash;oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;to do?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Sometimes I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can&rsquo;t change a habit, no matter how hard I try. Why?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;How quickly can I change a habit?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;What can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;How can I help someone else change a habit?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Why can I keep habits that benefit others, but can&rsquo;t make habits that are just for me?</p>\r\n<p>Whether readers want to get more sleep, stop checking their devices, maintain a healthy weight, or finish an important project, habits make&nbsp;change possible. Reading just a few chapters of <em>Better Than Before</em> will make readers eager to start work on their own habits&mdash;even before they&rsquo;ve finished the book.</p>",

Over the past forty years, KISS has sold more than 100 million CDs and DVDs worldwide and manages 5,000 licensed merchandise items--from comic books and coffins to action figures and video games. The band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 2014 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Have you ever felt your temper accelerate from zero to sixty when another driver cuts you off in traffic?</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: -4px 0px 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">As Marshall Goldsmith points out, our reactions don&rsquo;t occur in a vacuum. They are usually the result of unappreciated triggers in our environment&mdash;the people and situations that lure us into behaving in a manner diametrically opposed to the colleague, partner, parent, or friend we imagine ourselves to be. These triggers are constant and relentless and omnipresent. The smell of bacon wafts up from the kitchen, and we forget our doctor&rsquo;s advice on lowering our cholesterol. Our phone chirps, and we glance instinctively at the glaring screen instead of looking into the eyes of the person we are with. So often the environment seems to be outside our control. Even if that is true, as Goldsmith points out, we have a choice in how we respond.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: -4px 0px 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">In Triggers, his most powerful and insightful book yet, Goldsmith shows how we can overcome the trigger points in our lives, and enact meaningful and lasting change.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: -4px 0px 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Change, no matter how urgent and clear the need, is hard. Knowing what to do does not ensure that we will actually do it. We are superior planners, says Goldsmith, but become inferior doers as our environment exerts its influence through the course of our day. We forget our intentions. We become tired, even depleted, and allow our discipline to drain down like water in a leaky bucket. In Triggers, Goldsmith offers a simple &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; solution in the form of daily self-monitoring, hinging around what he calls &ldquo;active&rdquo; questions. These are questions that measure our effort, not our results. There&rsquo;s a difference between achieving and trying; we can&rsquo;t always achieve a desired result, but anyone can try. In the course of Triggers, Goldsmith details the six &ldquo;engaging questions&rdquo; that can help us take responsibility for our efforts to improve and help us recognize when we fall short.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: -4px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Filled with revealing and illuminating stories from his work with some of the most successful chief executives and power brokers in the business world, Goldsmith offers a personal playbook on how to achieve change in our lives, make it stick, and become the person we want to be.</p>",

That all changed when armed Somali pirates boarded the ship. The pirates didn&#39;t expect the crew to fight back, nor did they expect Captain Phillips to offer himself as hostage in exchange for the safety of his crew. Thus began the tense five-day stand-off, which ended in a daring high-seas rescue when U.S. Navy SEALs opened fire and picked off three of the captors.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&quot;It never ends like this,&quot; Captain Phillips said.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">And he&#39;s right.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">A Captain&#39;s Duty tells the life-and-death drama of the Vermont native who was held captive on a tiny lifeboat off Somalia&#39;s anarchic, gun-plagued shores. A story of adventure and courage, it provides the intimate details of this high-seas hostage-taking--the unbearable heat, the death threats, the mock executions, and the escape attempt. When the pirates boarded his ship, Captain Phillips put his experience into action, doing everything he could to safeguard his crew. And when he was held captive by the pirates, he marshaled all his resources to ensure his own survival, withstanding intense physical hardship and an escalating battle of wills with the pirates. This was it: the moment where training meets instinct and where character is everything. Richard Phillips was ready.</span></p>",

Some recognize the future is social, but most have a partial view. Social media, as Peter believes, is merely a tool. Becoming a social organization, however, is the future. What that requires is a profound shift in the way business is led. Peter strongly believes there is a better way to do business. His passion lies in changing the conversation around leadership by inspiring business leaders to explore the concept of Weology: How everyone wins when &ldquo;we&rdquo; comes before &ldquo;me&rdquo; and how it plays in the success of a business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why Peter? And why Tangerine? Nothing is average or normal at Tangerine: not the name, not the style of banking, not the leadership. And Peter Aceto is not your average executive. As president and CEO of Tangerine, Peter runs his business in an unorthodox and intuitively human way that has largely contributed to Tangerine&rsquo;s unprecedented success. In putting we before me, Peter has grown Tangerine into one of Canada&rsquo;s favourite companies to bank with and to work for.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Weology, Peter shares the story of Tangerine, its people, its culture and the leadership strategies he adopts for operating in a radically different way. The types of strategies that place people at the core of the operation: loyal, happy and engaged employees who positively impact the financial lives of two million Clients, and make shareholders happy, despite the bank&rsquo;s lack of traditional tellers and bricks-and-mortar branches.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Four years ago, the bestselling authors of The Challenger Sale overturned decades of conventional wisdom with a bold new approach to sales. Now their latest research reveals something even more surprising: being a Challenger seller isn&rsquo;t enough. Your success or failure also depends on who you challenge.</p>\r\n<p>Picture your ideal customer: friendly, eager to meet, ready to coach you through the sale and champion your products and services across the organization. It turns out that&rsquo;s the last person you need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Most marketing and sales teams go after low-hanging fruit: buyers who are eager and have clearly articulated needs. That&rsquo;s simply human nature; it&rsquo;s much easier to build a relationship with someone who always makes time for you, engages with your content, and listens attentively. But according to brand-new CEB research&mdash;based on data from thousands of B2B marketers, sellers, and buyers around the world&mdash;the highest-performing teams focus their time on potential customers who are far more skeptical, far less interested in meeting, and ultimately agnostic as to who wins the deal. How could this be?</p>\r\n<p>The authors of The Challenger Customer reveal that high-performing B2B teams grasp something that their average-performing peers don&rsquo;t: Now that big, complex deals increasingly require consensus among a wide range of players across the organization, the limiting factor is rarely the salesperson&rsquo;s inability to get an individual stakeholder to agree to a solution. More often it&rsquo;s that the stakeholders inside the company can&rsquo;t even agree with one another about what the problem is.</p>\r\n<p>It turns out only a very specific type of customer stakeholder has the credibility, persuasive skill, and will to effectively challenge his or her colleagues to pursue anything more ambitious than the status quo. These customers get deals to the finish line far more often than friendlier stakeholders who seem so receptive at first. In other words, Challenger sellers do best when they target Challenger customers.</p>\r\n<p>The Challenger Customer unveils research-based tools that will help you distinguish the &quot;Talkers&quot; from the &quot;Mobilizers&quot; in any organization. It also provides a blueprint for finding them, engaging them with disruptive insight, and equipping them to effectively challenge their own organization.</p>",

They were inspired by her mantra&mdash;find a way&mdash;that led her to realize a dream in her sixties that had eluded her as a young champion in peak form.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">In&nbsp;</span><i style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Find a Way,&nbsp;</i><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Diana engages us with a unique, passionate story of this heroic adventure and the extraordinary life experiences that have served to carve her unwavering spirit.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Diana was a world champion in her twenties, setting the record for swimming around Manhattan Island, along with other ocean-swim achievements, all of which rendered her a star at the time. Back then, she made the first attempt at the Mount Everest of swims, the Cuba Swim, but after forty-two hours and seventy-nine miles she was blown desperately off course. Her dream unfulfilled, she didn&rsquo;t swim another stroke for three decades.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Why, at sixty-four, was she able to achieve what she could not at thirty? How did her dramatic failures push her to success? What inner resources did Diana draw on during her long days and nights of training, and how did the power of the human spirit trump both the limitations of the body and the forces of nature across this vast, dangerous wilderness? This is the gripping story of an athlete, of a hero, of a bold mind. This is a galvanizing meditation on facing fears, engaging in our lives full throttle, and living each day with no regrets.&nbsp;</span></p>",

    "description": "<p>In her inspiring, deeply intelligent and intensely practical Our Turn, Kirstine Stewart draws on her own extensive leadership experience to take the conversation about women and work to a whole new level. Simply put: the time is now for new styles of leadership, and women are best-suited to set the pace.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kirstine Stewart got her first job when she applied for a position as a &quot;girl Friday&quot; at a film distribution house. Having worked her way up from the bottom--under women and men, leaders good and bad--she believes it&#39;s time we leaped past the question of how women might create change in the working world and exploit the fact that profound change is already under way. The digital revolution, and the wave of millennials who are entering the work force with very different expectations than the generations who preceded them, have created a new reality that demands a new style of leader with attributes and perspectives that make women the natural front-runners. The opportunity is there. The question Stewart tackles in Our Turn is how do we seize it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stewart&#39;s own track in the world has been exceptional, and littered with firsts, including being the first woman and the youngest person ever to head the CBC. Not only does she illuminate the broad strokes of the way forward for women, and her own principles of leadership, she digs down into the nitty-gritty of how she has managed to excel and to lead while staying true to who she is as a person. Whether you&#39;re the CEO or the administrative assistant, there is something for you in Our Turn.</p>",

You&rsquo;re not alone. Our usual approach is to just talk louder, to try harder to get our message through. This is almost always the wrong approach.</p>\r\n<p>Why? Because other people almost never see us the way we see ourselves. Fortunately, these distortions in perception are systematic, understandable, and surmountable.</p>\r\n<p>Heidi Grant Halvorson, bestselling author of <em>Nine Things Successful People Do Differently</em> and <em>Focus</em>, now shows you how to communicate effectively&mdash;despite these unintentional (yet widespread) distortions of perception. By better understanding how communication and perception really work, you&rsquo;ll learn to send the right signals at the right time, no matter who you&rsquo;re communicating with.</p>",

While at an official ceremony with husband and Chief of Staff, Rod Calloway, she is informed by the President&#39;s Chief of Staff, Jim Gardner, and the Attorney General that President Bridges is about to undergo emergency brain surgery for a tumor. Mackenzie is stunned when Gardner tells her that in the event the President does not recover, the party doesn&#39;t want her to succeed him. Instead, she&#39;s asked to step down in order to allow the Speaker of the House to assume the post, as he shares the party&#39;s ideals. Mackenzie&#39;s doubts are confirmed when she visits President Bridges at the hospital and hears from him directly that he wants her to resign. Bridges dies before transition plans are finalized, however, and after sitting through an insulting and sexist conversation with Speaker of the House, Nathan Templeton, Mackenzie decides to forge ahead and assume the presidency despite the obstacles that lie ahead. Aside from the challenges Mackenzie faces, husband Rod has his own hurdles to overcome, as he finds himself being ushered into a pink and feminine office by the first lady&#39;s aide. Her children, six-year-old Amy, as well as twins Horace, one of the most popular kids in school, and Rebecca, a rebellious teenager with raging hormones, must also learn to deal with their mother&#39;s new role of the leader of the free world. Meeting with a saddened Congress and addressing a stunned nation, Mackenzie delivers an inaugural speech with the help of press secretary Kelly Ludlow, which manages to unite a grieving country, quell the critics who feel she&#39;s not up to the task, and look to the bright future which lies ahead, led by the first female President of the United States.</span></p>",

Older, prettier, more settled and married Dottie is the catcher for the local softball team sponsored by Lukash Dairy. Kit is her younger sister, and pitcher on the same team, who feels that she can&#39;t measure up to Dottie in her own eyes, or in the eyes of others. With so many young men overseas fighting the Axis, there is a danger that professional baseball will be shut down for the duration of the war. A well-known candy manufacturer, Walter Harvey (Gary Marshall), contrives the idea to create a professional baseball league for women; both the keep the sport alive and to make a buck or two. Dottie is recruited by a scout (John Lovitz) for this new league but refuses to go unless her sister is allowed on the team. On the way to Chicago they also intervene to get an outstanding batter, Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanaugh) a try-out as well. Once in Chicago, they are introduced to the other girls who will be on one of the four teams: May and Doris (Madonna and Rosie O&#39;Donnell) are close friends from New York; Shirley Baker (Anne Cusack) is an illiterate farm-girl. These women, along with their team-mates, begin a journey that opens up a whole new world, far beyond that of the baseball diamond, lead by team manager, Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), a washed-up star ruined by alcohol and angered and embarrassed to be the coach of a girl&#39;s team.</span></p>",

Examining how promotion/prevention focus applies across a wide range of situations&mdash;from selling products to managing employees to raising children to getting a second date&mdash;Halvorson and Higgins show us how to identify, change, and use focus to get the results we want.</span></p>",

And it&#39;s burning us out.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So what if you first got clear on how you actually wanted to feel in your life, and then created some &quot;Goals with Soul&quot;?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With The Desire Map, Danielle LaPorte brings you a holistic life-planning tool that will revolutionize the way you go after what you want in life. Unapologetically passionate and with plenty of warm wit, LaPorte turns the concept of ambition inside out and offers an inspired, refreshingly practical workbook for using the Desire Map process:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n\t<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Identify your &quot;core desired feelings&quot; in every life domain: livelihood &amp; lifestyle, body &amp; wellness, creativity &amp; learning, relationships &amp; society, and essence &amp; spirituality</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n\t<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Create practical &quot;Goals with Soul&quot; to generate your core desired feelings</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n\t<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why easing up on your expectations actually liberates you to reach your goals</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n\t<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Self-assessment quizzes, worksheets, and complete Desire Mapping tools for creating the life you truly long for</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Goal-setting just got a makeover.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are more than 10,000 &quot;Desire Mappers&quot; who have worked through this system. &quot;Every day I get stories about inner clarity, quitting jobs, dumping the chump, renewing vows, pole-dancing classes, writing memoirs, moving on,&quot; says Danielle. &quot;This is about liberation. And pleasure. And self-determination. This is about doing much less proving, and way more living.&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you&#39;ve had enough of trying to trick yourself into happiness through affirmations or bucket-listing your hopes into some distant future, then you&#39;re ready for The Desire Map - a dream-fulfilling system that harnesses your soul-deep desire to feel good.</p>",

Her husband and two young sons encouraged her to pursue the job; she had a tremendously supportive boss, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and she had been moving up on a high-profile career track since law school. But then life intervened. Parenting needs caused her to make a decision to leave the State Department and return to an academic career that gave her more time for her family.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The reactions to her choice to leave Washington because of her kids led her to question the feminist narrative she grew up with.

Though many solutions have been proposed for how women can continue to break the glass ceiling or rise above the &ldquo;motherhood penalty,&rdquo; women at the top and the bottom of the income scale are further and further apart.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Now, in her refreshing and forthright voice, Anne-Marie Slaughter returns with her vision for what true equality between men and women really means, and how we can get there. She uncovers the missing piece of the puzzle, presenting a new focus that can reunite the women&rsquo;s movement and provide a common banner under which both men and women can advance and thrive.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">With moving personal stories, individual action plans, and a broad outline for change, Anne-Marie Slaughter reveals a future in which all of us can finally finish the business of equality for women and men, work and family.</span></p>",

This book presents the far-reaching argument that not only should we have a new world order but that we already do. Anne-Marie Slaughter asks us to completely rethink how we view the political world. It&#39;s not a collection of nation states that communicate through presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, and the United Nations. Nor is it a clique of NGOs. It is governance through a complex global web of &quot;government networks.&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Slaughter provides the most compelling and authoritative description to date of a world in which government officials--police investigators, financial regulators, even judges and legislators--exchange information and coordinate activity across national borders to tackle crime, terrorism, and the routine daily grind of international interactions. National and international judges and regulators can also work closely together to enforce international agreements more effectively than ever before. These networks, which can range from a group of constitutional judges exchanging opinions across borders to more established organizations such as the G8 or the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, make things happen--and they frequently make good things happen. But they are underappreciated and, worse, underused to address the challenges facing the world today.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The modern political world, then, consists of states whose component parts are fast becoming as important as their central leadership. Slaughter not only describes these networks but also sets forth a blueprint for how they can better the world. Despite questions of democratic accountability, this new world order is not one in which some &quot;world government&quot; enforces global dictates. The governments we already have at home are our best hope for tackling the problems we face abroad, in a networked world order.</span></p>",

The Element has inspired readers all over the world and has created for Robinson an intensely devoted following. Now comes the long-awaited companion, the practical guide that helps people find their own Element. Among the questions that this new book answers are:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow do I find out what my talents and passions are?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat if I love something I&rsquo;m not good at?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat if I&rsquo;m good at something I don&rsquo;t love?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat if I can&rsquo;t make a living from my Element?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow do I do help my children find their Element?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinding Your Element comes at a critical time as concerns about the economy, education and the environment continue to grow. The need to connect to our personal talents and passions has never been greater. &nbsp;As Robinson writes in his introduction, wherever you are, whatever you do, and no matter how old you are, if you&rsquo;re searching for your Element, this book is for you.</p>",

When people arrive at the Element, they feel most themselves and most inspired and achieve at their highest levels. With a wry sense of humor, Ken Robinson looks at the conditions that enable us to find ourselves in the Element and those that stifle that possibility. Drawing on the stories of a wide range of people, including Paul McCartney, Matt Groening, Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, and Bart Conner, he shows that age and occupation are no barrier and that this is the essential strategy for transform&shy;ing education, business, and communities in the twenty-first century.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso available from Ken Robinson is Finding Your Element, the practical guide to achieving your highest potential.</p>",

But for most busy, overworked managers, coaching employees is done badly, or not at all. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re just too busy, and it&rsquo;s too hard to change.</p>\r\n<p>But what if managers could coach their people in 10 minutes or less?</p>\r\n<p>In Michael Bungay Stanier&rsquo;s The Coaching Habit, coaching becomes a regular, informal part of your day so managers and their teams can work less hard and have more impact.</p>\r\n<p>Coaching is an art and it&rsquo;s far easier said than done. It takes courage to ask a question rather than offer up advice, provide an answer, or unleash a solution. Giving another person the opportunity to find their own way, make their own mistakes, and create their own wisdom is both brave and vulnerable. It can also mean unlearning our &ldquo;fix it&rdquo; habits. In this practical and inspiring book, Michael shares seven transformative questions that can make a difference in how we lead and support. And, he guides us through the tricky part - how to take this new information and turn it into habits and a daily practice.</p>\r\n<p>&ndash;&ndash;Bren&eacute; Brown, author of Rising Strong and Daring Greatly</p>\r\n<p>Drawing on years of experience training more than 10,000 busy managers from around the globe in practical, everyday coaching skills, Bungay Stanier reveals how to unlock your peoples&rsquo; potential. He unpacks seven essential coaching questions to demonstrate how&mdash;by saying less and asking more&mdash;you can develop coaching methods that produce great results.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Get straight to the point in any conversation with The Kickstart Question</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stay on track during any interaction with The AWE Question</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Save hours of time for yourself with The Lazy Question, and hours of time for others with The Strategic Question</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Get to the heart of any interpersonal or external challenge with The Focus Question and The Foundation Question</p>\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, ensure others find your coaching as beneficial as you do with The Learning Question</p>\r\n<p>A fresh, innovative take on the traditional how-to manual, the book combines insider information with research based in neuroscience and behavioural economics, together with interactive training tools to turn practical advice into practiced habits. Dynamic question-and-answer sections help identify old habits and kick-start new behaviour, making sure you get the most out of all seven chapters. Witty and conversational, The Coaching Habit takes your work&mdash;and your workplace&mdash;from good to great.</p>",

Winning that time has never been more difficult and staying top of mind is even tougher.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe answer to cutting through and building trust isn&#39;t found in a sea of management jargon. It&#39;s based on three words: Think. Do. Say.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGreat people and great organizations succeed in this busy, busy world based on:<br />\r\n\t1.

    "description": "<p>Eighty percent of companies say they deliver out&shy;standing customer service, but only 8 percent of their customers agree. This book will help you close that gap by reconfiguring your customer service to deliver knockout experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The near-universal adoption of smartphones and social media has fundamentally altered the science of complaints. Critics (&ldquo;haters&rdquo;) can now express their displeasure faster and more pub&shy;licly than ever. These trends have resulted in an overall increase in complaints and a belief by many businesses that they have to &ldquo;pick their spots&rdquo; when choosing to answer criticisms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bestselling author Jay Baer shows why that approach is a major mistake. Based on an exten&shy;sive proprietary study of how, where, and why we complain, Hug Your Haters proves that there are two types of complainers, each with very differ&shy;ent motivations:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Offstage haters. These people simply want solutions to their problems. They complain via legacy channels where the likelihood of a response is highest&mdash;phone, e-mail, and com&shy;pany websites. Offstage haters don&rsquo;t care if any&shy;one else finds out, as long as they get answers.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Onstage haters. These people are often disap&shy;pointed by a substandard interaction via tradi&shy;tional channels, so they turn to indirect venues, such as social media, online review sites, and discussion boards. Onstage haters want more than solutions&mdash;they want an audience to share their righteous indignation.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Hug Your Haters shows exactly how to deal with both groups, drawing on meticulously researched case studies from businesses of all types and sizes from around the world. It includes specific play&shy;books and formulas as well as a fold-out poster of &ldquo;the Hatrix,&rdquo; which summarizes the best strate&shy;gies for different situations. The book is also filled with poignant and hilarious examples of haters gone wild, and companies gone crazy, as well as inspirational stories of companies responding with speed, compassion, and humanity.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you work for a mom-and-pop store or a global brand, you will have haters&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t afford to ignore them. Baer&rsquo;s insights and tactics will teach you how to embrace complaints, put haters to work for you, and turn bad news into good outcomes.</p>",

Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics&mdash;as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, FBI agents, airplane pilots, and Broadway songwriters&mdash;this painstakingly researched book explains that the most productive people, companies, and organizations don&rsquo;t merely act differently.</p>\r\n<p>They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways.</p>\r\n<p>A young woman drops out of a PhD program and starts playing poker. By training herself to envision contradictory futures, she learns to anticipate her opponents&rsquo; missteps&mdash;and becomes one of the most successful players in the world.</p>\r\n<p>A group of data scientists at Google embark on a four-year study of how the best teams function, and find that how a group interacts is more important than who is in the group&mdash;a principle, it turns out, that also helps explain why Saturday Night Live became a hit.</p>\r\n<p>A Marine Corps general, faced with low morale among recruits, reimagines boot camp&mdash;and discovers that instilling a &ldquo;bias toward action&rdquo; can turn even the most directionless teenagers into self-motivating achievers.</p>\r\n<p>The filmmakers behind Disney&rsquo;s Frozen are nearly out of time and on the brink of catastrophe&mdash;until they shake up their team in just the right way, spurring a creative breakthrough that leads to one of the highest-grossing movies of all time.</p>\r\n<p>What do these people have in common?</p>\r\n<p>They know that productivity relies on making certain choices. The way we frame our daily decisions; the big ambitions we embrace and the easy goals we ignore; the cultures we establish as leaders to drive innovation; the way we interact with data: These are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive.</p>\r\n<p>In The Power of Habit, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Duhigg explained why we do what we do. In Smarter Faster Better, he applies the same relentless curiosity, deep reporting, and rich storytelling to explain how we can improve at the things we do. It&rsquo;s a groundbreaking exploration of the science of productivity, one that can help anyone learn to succeed with less stress and struggle, and to get more done without sacrificing what we care about most&mdash;to become smarter, faster, and better at everything we do.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>",

    "description": "<p>&ldquo;While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, I&rsquo;ve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.&rdquo; &ndash;from the Prologue</p><p>\nMany of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.</p><p>\n<i>The Ego is the Enemy</i> draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.</p><p>\nBut why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion?&nbsp; Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, &ldquo;you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you&rsquo;ve set out to achieve.&rdquo;</p>",

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tThe <i>New York Times</i>bestselling author of <i>Contagious</i> explores the subtle, secret influences that affect the decisions we make&mdash;from what we buy, to the careers we choose, to what we eat&mdash;in this fascinating and groundbreaking work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you&rsquo;re like most people, you think that your choices and behaviors are driven by your individual, personal tastes, and opinions. You wear a certain jacket because you liked the way it looked. You picked a particular career because you found it interesting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions is patently obvious. Right? Wrong.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout our realizing it, other people&rsquo;s behavior has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane to the momentous occasion. Even strangers have a startling impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes toward a welfare policy shift if we&rsquo;re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans (even though the policy is the same in both cases).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut social influence doesn&rsquo;t just lead us to do the same things as others. In some cases we conform, or imitate others around us. But in other cases we diverge, or <i>avoid</i> particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don&rsquo;t want to look like a soccer mom.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn his surprising and compelling <i>Invisible Influence</i>, Jonah Berger integrates research and thinking from business, psychology, and social science to focus on the subtle, invisible influences behind our choices as individuals. By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it&mdash;and how we can use this knowledge to make better-informed decisions and exercise more control over our own behavior.</p>",

As journalists do, she decided to find out if she was alone in this feeling and how she could fix it. She was relieved to discover that most working mothers felt as crazed as she did. Few of them were really enjoying &ldquo;leisure&rdquo; time. They weren&rsquo;t complaining; they chose to have children and to work, and they made the best of it. But what about that term women&rsquo;s magazines are so fond of: &ldquo;me time&rdquo;? Was there anything working mothers could do to make their lives feel less like a treadmill gone haywire? Anything they could change?</p><p>\nSchulte interviewed working mothers and examined how not just individual pressures but biological, societal, economic and cultural ones were splintering their days into slivered messes. She explored everything from the wiring of the female brain to male&ndash;female income distribution and the current state of gender equality in the workplace and home. She talked to neuroscientists, sociologists, and above all, other working mothers in order to tease out all the factors contributing to our collective overwhelm. And then she sought out insights and answers and inspiration: investigating companies, travelling across Western Europe to meet families and researchers, and seeking out the sages of the age for their wisdom on how to manage time.</p><p>\n<i>Overwhelmed</i> is the story of what she found out. It&rsquo;s a map of the stresses&mdash;individual, historical, biological and societal&mdash;that have ripped working mothers&rsquo; leisure to shreds, and a look at how it might be possible to put the pieces back together.</p>",

The answer is agility&mdash;emotional agility.</p><p>\nEmotional agility is a four-step approach that allows us to navigate life&rsquo;s twists and turns with self-acceptance, clear-sightedness, and an open mind.

Emotionally agile people experience the same stresses and setbacks as anyone else, but they know how to adapt, aligning their actions with their values and making small changes that lead to a life of growth.</p><p>\nDrawing on her extensive professional research, her international consulting work, and her own experiences growing up in Apartheid-era South Africa and losing her father at a young age, David shows how anyone can become more emotionally agile and thrive in an uncertain world.

Based on extensive research and decades of experience with leaders, this book sheds new light on the powerful relationship of happiness to individual, team, and organizational success.</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">McKee&rsquo;s research reveals that there are three essential elements that people&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">must have</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">&nbsp;in order to be happy at work:</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\"> A sense of purpose and the chance to contribute to something bigger than themselves;</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\"> A vision that is powerful and personal, creating a real sense of hope; and</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\"> Resonant, friendly relationships</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">The book is organized around these essential elements and shows how leaders can create and sustain them in the face of ongoing stress and pressure, as well as how to create a healthy, positive climate for their teams and other groups within their companies.</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">How to Be Happy at Work</span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-variant-ligatures: none; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">&nbsp;will transform and enrich our understanding of what it means to be happy at work, and it will provide clear, practical advice and instruction for how to achieve this.</span></p>",

Leaders everywhere recognized the validity of resonant leadership, but struggled with how to achieve and sustain resonance amid the relentless demands of work and life. Now, Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee provide an indispensable guide to overcoming the vicious cycle of stress, sacrifice, and dissonance that afflicts many leaders. Drawing from extensive multidisciplinary research and real-life stories, Resonant Leadership offers a field-tested framework for creating the resonance that fuels great leadership. Rather than constantly sacrificing themselves to workplace demands, leaders can manage the cycle using specific techniques to combat stress, avoid burnout, and renew themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally. The book reveals that the path to resonance is through mindfulness, hope, and compassion and shows how intentionally employing these qualities creates effective and enduring leadership. Great leaders are resonant leaders. Resonant Leadership offers the inspiration--and tools--to spark and sustain resonance in ourselves and in those we lead.</span></p>",

We tell ourselves we&#39;d like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren&#39;t enough hours to do it all. Or if we don&#39;t make excuses, we make sacrifices- taking time out from other things in order to fit it all in. There has to be a better way...and Laura Vanderkam has found one. After interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, she realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us. Instead of letting the daily grind crowd out the important stuff, they start by making sure there&#39;s time for the important stuff. When plans go wrong and they run out of time, only their lesser priorities suffer. Vanderkam shows that with a little examination and prioritizing, you&#39;ll find it is possible to sleep eight hours a night, exercise five days a week, take piano lessons, and write a novel without giving up quality time for work, family, and other things that really matter.</span></p>",

What if all those tragic anecdotes ignore the women who quietly but consistently do just fine with the juggle?</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">Instead of relying on scattered stories, time management expert Laura Vanderkam set out to add hard data to the debate. She collected hour-by-hour time logs from 1,001 days in the lives of women who make at least $100,000 a year. And she found some surprising patterns in how these women spend the 168 hours that every one of us has each week.</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">Overall, these women worked less and slept more than they assumed they did before they started</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">tracking their time. They went jogging or to the gym, played with their children, scheduled date nights with their significant others, and had lunches&nbsp;with friends. They made time for the things that gave them pleasure and meaning, fitting the pieces together&nbsp;like tiles in a mosaic&mdash;without adhering to overly&nbsp;rigid schedules that would eliminate flexibility&nbsp;and spontaneity.</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">Vanderkam shares specific strategies that her subjects use to make time for the things that really matter to them.

Breakfasts together and morning story time count as much as daily family dinners, and they&rsquo;re often easier to manage.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\" />\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: &quot;Gibson Light&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.45px;\">* Take it easy on the housework.

Like so many driven and talented women who have been brought up to believe that to have it all, they must do it all, Dufu began to feel that achieving her career and personal goals was an impossibility. Eventually, she discovered the solution: letting go. In Drop the Ball, Dufu recounts how she learned to reevaluate expectations, shrink her to-do list, and meaningfully engage the assistance of others-freeing the space she needed to flourish at work and to develop deeper, more meaningful relationships at home.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven though women are half the workforce, they still represent only eighteen per cent of the highest level leaders. The reasons are obvious: just as women reach middle management they are also starting families. Mounting responsibilities at work and home leave them with no bandwidth to do what will most lead to their success. Offering new perspective on why the women&#39;s leadership movement has stalled, and packed with actionable advice, Tiffany Dufu&#39;s Drop the Ball urges women to embrace imperfection, to expect less of themselves and more from others-only then can they focus on what they truly care about, devote the necessary energy to achieving their real goals, and create the type of rich, rewarding life we all desire.</p>",

What we need is nothing short of a sleep revolution: only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn The Sleep Revolution, Arianna explores all the latest science on what exactly is going on while we sleep and dream. She takes on the sleeping pill industry, and all the ways our addiction to technology disrupts our sleep. She also offers a range of recommendations and tips from leading scientists on how we can get better and more restorative sleep, and harness its incredible power.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe result is a sweeping, scientifically rigorous, and deeply personal exploration of sleep from all angles, from the history of sleep, to the role of dreams in our lives, to the consequences of sleep deprivation, and the new golden age of sleep science that reveals the vital role sleep plays in our every waking moment and every aspect of our health--from weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease to cancer and Alzheimer&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn today&#39;s fast-paced, always-connected, perpetually-harried and sleep-deprived world, our need for a good night&rsquo;s sleep is more important--and elusive--than ever.

Seventy-seven percent of leaders think they do a good job of engaging their people, yet 88 percent of employees say their leaders don&#39;t engage enough. There is also a high level of suffering in the workplace: 35 percent of employees would forgo a pay raise to see their leaders fired.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is an enormous waste of human talent--despite the fact that $46 billion is spent each year on leadership development.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBased on extensive research, including assessments of more than 35,000 leaders and interviews with 250 C-level executives, The Mind of the Leader concludes that organizations and leaders aren&#39;t meeting employees&#39; basic human needs of finding meaning, purpose, connection, and genuine happiness in their work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut more than a description of the problem, The Mind of the Leader offers a radical, yet practical, solution. To solve the leadership crisis, organizations need to put people at the center of their strategy. They need to develop managers and executives who lead with three core mental qualities: mindfulness, selflessness, and compassion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUsing real-world inspirational examples from Marriott, Accenture, McKinsey &amp; Company, LinkedIn, and many more, The Mind of the Leader shows how this new kind of leadership turns conventional leadership thinking upside down. It represents a radical redefinition of what it takes to be an effective leader--and a practical, hard-nosed solution to every organization&#39;s engagement and execution problems.</p>",

This deceptively simple question continues to confound professionals in all sectors of the workforce. Now, after a unique, five-year study of more than 5,000 managers and employees, Morten Hansen reveals the answers in his &ldquo;Seven Work Smarter Practices&rdquo; that can be applied by anyone looking to maximize their time and performance.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEach of Hansen&rsquo;s seven practices is highlighted by inspiring stories from individuals in his comprehensive study. You&rsquo;ll meet a high school principal who engineered a dramatic turnaround of his failing high school; a rural Indian farmer determined to establish a better way of life for women in his village; and a sushi chef, whose simple preparation has led to his restaurant (tucked away under a Tokyo subway station underpass) being awarded the maximum of three Michelin stars. Hansen also explains how the way Alfred Hitchcock filmed Psycho and the 1911 race to become the first explorer to reach the South Pole both illustrate the use of his seven practices (even before they were identified).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEach chapter contains questions and key insights to allow you to assess your own performance and figure out your work strengths, as well as your weaknesses. Once you understand your individual style, there are mini-quizzes, questionnaires, and clear tips to assist you focus on a strategy to become a more productive worker.

    "description": "<div>\r\n\tThe book that shows how to get the job done and deliver results . . . whether you&rsquo;re running an entire company or in your first management job</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tLarry Bossidy is one of the world&rsquo;s most acclaimed CEOs, a man with few peers who has a track record for delivering results. Ram Charan is a legendary advisor to senior executives and boards of directors, a man with unparalleled insight into why some companies are successful and others are not. Together they&rsquo;ve pooled their knowledge and experience into the one book on how to close the gap between results promised and results delivered that people in business need today.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tAfter a long, stellar career with General Electric, Larry Bossidy transformed AlliedSignal into one of the world&rsquo;s most admired companies and was named CEO of the year in 1998 by Chief Executive magazine. Accomplishments such as 31 consecutive quarters of earnings-per-share growth of 13 percent or more didn&rsquo;t just happen; they resulted from the consistent practice of the discipline of execution: understanding how to link together people, strategy, and operations, the three core processes of every business.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tLeading these processes is the real job of running a business, not formulating a &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and leaving the work of carrying it out to others. Bossidy and Charan show the importance of being deeply and passionately engaged in an organization and why robust dialogues about people, strategy, and operations result in a business based on intellectual honesty and realism.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe leader&rsquo;s most important job&mdash;selecting and appraising people&mdash;is one that should never be delegated. As a CEO, Larry Bossidy personally makes the calls to check references for key hires. Why? With the right people in the right jobs, there&rsquo;s a leadership gene pool that conceives and selects strategies that can be executed. People then work together to create a strategy building block by building block, a strategy in sync with the realities of the marketplace, the economy, and the competition. Once the right people and strategy are in place, they are then linked to an operating process that results in the implementation of specific programs and actions and that assigns accountability. This kind of effective operating process goes way beyond the typical budget exercise that looks into a rearview mirror to set its goals. It puts reality behind the numbers and is where the rubber meets the road.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tPutting an execution culture in place is hard, but losing it is easy. In July 2001 Larry Bossidy was asked by the board of directors of Honeywell International (it had merged with AlliedSignal) to return and get the company back on track. He&rsquo;s been putting the ideas he writes about in Execution to work in real time.</div>",

Filled with examples of forward-thinking companies that have adopted radical new approaches to talent (such as ADP, Amgen, BlackRock, Blackstone, Haier, ING, Marsh, Tata Communications, Telenor, and Volvo), as well as the juggernauts and the startups of Silicon Valley, this book shows leaders how to bring the rigor that they apply to financial capital to their human capital--elevating HR to the same level as finance in their organizations.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tProviding deep, expert insight and advice for what needs to change and how to change it, this is the definitive book for reimagining and creating a talent-driven organization that wins.</div>",

As president and cofounder of Rose Park Advisors&#39; Disruptive Innovation Fund with Clayton Christensen, Johnson used the theory of disruptive innovation to invest in publicly traded stocks and private early-stage companies. In Disrupt Yourself, she helps you understand how the frameworks of disruptive innovation can apply to your particular path, whether you are: a self-starter ready to make a disruptive pivot in your business a high-potential individual charting your career trajectory a manager looking to instill innovative thinking amongst your team a leader facing industry changes that make for an uncertain future We are living in an era of accelerating disruption; no one is immune.

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tAt the end of 2008, Ford Motor Company was just months away from running out of cash. With the auto industry careening toward ruin, Congress offered all three Detroit automakers a bailout. General Motors and Chrysler grabbed the taxpayer lifeline, but Ford decided to save itself. Under the leadership of charismatic CEO Alan Mulally, Ford had already put together a bold plan to unify its divided global operations, transform its lackluster product lineup, and overcome a dys&shy;functional culture of infighting, backstabbing, and excuses. It was an extraordinary risk, but it was the only way the Ford family&mdash;America&rsquo;s last great industrial dynasty&mdash;could hold on to their company. Mulally and his team pulled off one of the great&shy;est comebacks in business history. As the rest of Detroit collapsed, Ford went from the brink of bankruptcy to being the most profitable automaker in the world. American Icon is the compelling, behind-the-scenes account of that epic turnaround.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn one of the great management narratives of our time, Hoffman puts the reader inside the boardroom as Mulally uses his celebrated Business Plan Review meet&shy;ings to drive change and force Ford to deal with the painful realities of the American auto industry. Hoffman was granted unprecedented access to Ford&rsquo;s top executives and top-secret company documents. He spent countless hours with Alan Mulally, Bill Ford, the Ford family, former executives, labor leaders, and company directors. In the bestselling tradition of Too Big to Fail and The Big Short, American Icon is narrative nonfiction at its vivid and colorful best.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\r\n\t<strong>She faced years of abuse after arriving in Canada as a teenage bride in a hastily arranged marriage, but nothing could stop Samra Zafar from pursuing her dreams.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt 15, Samra Zafar had big dreams for herself. She was going to go to university, and forge her own path. Then with almost no warning, those dreams were pulled away from her when she was suddenly married to a stranger at 17 and had to leave behind her family in Pakistan to move to Canada. Her new husband and his family promised that the marriage and the move would be a fulfillment of her dream, not a betrayal of it. But as the walls of their home slowly became a prison, Samra realized the promises were empty ones.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the years that followed she suffered her husband&rsquo;s emotional and physical abuse that left her feeling isolated, humiliated and assaulted. Desperate to get out, and refusing to give up, she hatched an escape plan for herself and her two daughters. Somehow she found the strength to not only build a new future, but to walk away from her past, ignoring the pleas of her family and risking cultural isolation by divorcing her husband.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut that end was only the beginning for Samra. Through her academic and career achievements, she has gone on to become a mentor and public speaker, connecting with people around the world from isolated women in situations similar to her own, to young schoolgirls in Kenya who never allowed themselves to dream to men making the decisions to save for their daughters&rsquo; educations instead of their dowries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>A Good Wife&nbsp;</em>tell her harrowing and inspiring story, following her from a young girl with big dreams, through finding strength in the face of oppression and then finally battling through to empowerment.</p>",

With grace, heart, and humor, she writes about overcoming breast cancer only to learn five years later that she will need a bone marrow transplant to combat a rare blood disorder, the grief and heartbreak she suffered when her mother passed away, her triumphant return to GMA after her medical leave, and the tremendous support and love of her family and friends that saw her through her difficult times.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFollowing her mother&#39;s advice to &quot;make your mess your message,&quot; Robin taught a nation of viewers that while it is true that we&#39;ve all got something &mdash; a medical crisis to face, aging parents to care for, heartbreak in all its many forms &mdash; we&#39;ve also all got something to give: hope, encouragement, a life-saving transplant or a spirit&#39;saving embrace. As Robin has learned, and what readers of her remarkable story will come to believe as well, it&#39;s all about faith, family and friends.

Willink and Babin returned home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training that helped forge the next generation of SEAL leaders. After departing the SEAL Teams, they launched Echelon Front, a company that teaches these same leadership principles to businesses and organizations. From promising startups to Fortune 500 companies, Babin and Willink have helped scores of clients across a broad range of industries build their own high-performance teams and dominate their battlefields.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow, detailing the mind-set and principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult missions in combat, <em>Extreme Ownership</em> shows how to apply them to any team, family or organization. Each chapter focuses on a specific topic such as Cover and Move, Decentralized Command, and Leading Up the Chain, explaining what they are, why they are important, and how to implement them in any leadership environment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, <em>Extreme Ownership</em> revolutionizes business management and challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.</p>",

Now, in <em>The Dichotomy of Leadership,</em> Jocko and Leif dive even deeper into the unchartered and complex waters of a concept first introduced in <em>Extreme Ownership</em>: finding balance between the opposing forces that pull every leader in different directions. Here, Willink and Babin get granular into the nuances that every successful leader must navigate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMastering the <em>Dichotomy of Leadership</em> requires understanding when to lead and when to follow; when to aggressively maneuver and when to pause and let things develop; when to detach and let the team run and when to dive into the details and micromanage. In addition, every leader must:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&middot; Take <em>Extreme Ownership</em> of everything that impacts their mission, yet utilize Decentralize Command by giving ownership to their team.<br />\r\n\t&middot; Care deeply about their people and their individual success and livelihoods, yet look out for the good of the overall team and above all accomplish the strategic mission.<br />\r\n\t&middot; Exhibit the most important quality in a leader―humility, but also be willing to speak up and push back against questionable decisions that could hurt the team and the mission.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith examples from the authors&rsquo; combat and training experiences in the SEAL teams, and then a demonstration of how each lesson applies to the business world, Willink and Babin clearly explain THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP―skills that are mission-critical for any leader and any team to achieve their ultimate goal: VICTORY.</p>",

Your competencies should be measured and your weaknesses shored up. Leadership is a thing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese may sound like basic truths of our work lives today. But actually, they&#39;re lies. As strengths guru and bestselling author Marcus Buckingham and Cisco Leadership and Team Intelligence head Ashley Goodall show in this provocative, inspiring book, there are some big lies--distortions, faulty assumptions, wrong thinking--that we encounter every time we show up for work. Nine lies, to be exact. They cause dysfunction and frustration, ultimately resulting in workplaces that are a pale shadow of what they could be.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there are those who can get past the lies and discover what&#39;s real. These freethinking leaders recognize the power and beauty of our individual uniqueness. They know that emergent patterns are more valuable than received wisdom and that evidence is more powerful than dogma.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith engaging stories and incisive analysis, the authors reveal the essential truths that such freethinking leaders will recognize immediately: that it is the strength and cohesiveness of your team, not your company&#39;s culture, that matter most; that we should focus less on top-down planning and more on giving our people reliable, real-time intelligence; that rather than trying to align people&#39;s goals we should strive to align people&#39;s sense of purpose and meaning; that people don&#39;t want constant feedback, they want helpful attention.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the real world of work, as it is and as it should be. Nine Lies About Work reveals the few core truths that will help you show just how good you are to those who truly rely on you.</p>",

Clifton) in print, Cambridge-educated Buckingham is considered one of the most respected business authorities on the subject of management and leadership in the world. With <em>The One Thing You Need to Know</em>, he gives readers an invaluable course in outstanding achievement -- a guide to capturing the essence of the three most fundamental areas of professional activity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGreat managing, leading, and career success -- Buckingham draws on a wealth of applicable examples to reveal that a controlling insight lies at the heart of the three. Lose sight of this &quot;one thing&quot; and even the best efforts will be diminished or compromised. Readers will be eager to discover the surprisingly different answers to each of these rich and complex subjects. Each could be explained endlessly to detail their many facets, but Buckingham&#39;s great gift is his ability to cut through the mass of often-conflicting agendas and zero in on what matters most, without ever oversimplifying. As he observes, success comes to those who remain mindful of the core insight, understand all of its ramifications, and orient their decisions around it. Buckingham backs his arguments with authoritative research from a wide variety of sources, including his own research data and in-depth interviews with individuals at every level of an organization, from CEO&#39;s to hotel maids and stockboys.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn every way a groundbreaking book, <em>The One Thing You Need to Know</em> offers crucial performance and career lessons for business people at all career stages.</p>",

After all, conflict is antithetical to teamwork, employee engagement, and a positive company culture. Or is it?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe truth is that our teams and organizations require conflict to get things done. But we avoid conflict and build up conflict debt by deferring and dodging the difficult decisions.

One side effect of living in our era of abundance is that we no longer have the tools to handle failure or even perceived failure. We are turning into an army of porcelain dolls.

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tTo be a successful entrepreneur, you don&rsquo;t just need to know how to run a business. You need to know how to run your life when the boundary between work and personal time has essentially been erased. But while there are countless books on setting up a company, there hasn&rsquo;t ever been a primer on navigating the unique emotional and personal demands of entrepreneurship. That&rsquo;s what All In is all about: how to thrive in the entrepreneurial lifestyle&mdash;and how to avoid its pitfalls.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn All In, Arlene Dickinson tells the truth about the dangers of believing your own hype, listening to aysayers&mdash;and ignoring naysayers, too. Dickinson explains why the need for control is a double-edged sword that can get a business off the ground, then cause it to stall. She also discusses what the need for control does to a marriage&mdash;and how success can test family relationships even more than failure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll In will open a new level of dialogue in the entrepreneurial community, bringing often-unspoken truths into the light and showing readers all the ways they&rsquo;ll be tested in their new endeavour. Packed with Dickinson&rsquo;s own hard-won lessons, and those of other successful entrepreneurs, All In is for every small business owner who&rsquo;s ever felt like they&rsquo;re the only one and every coffee-break dreamer wondering if they can hack it. At its best, the entrepreneurial lifestyle is all about independence&mdash;not just financial independence, but the psychological independence that comes from charting your own course&mdash;and All In will help readers achieve that freedom.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tAn inspiring new voice in the field of resiliency gives a tender, powerful and achievable path to rise from adversities through self-acceptance and self-alignment - always based on being enough in the here and now rather than the untenable quest to be more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobyne Hanley-Dafoe learned resilience from the ground up - not just as an accomplished university researcher, but first by overcoming mental illness, the stigma of being a high-school dropout, and almost dying in a car crash at age sixteen. Here, she presents an attainable model for everyday resilience, which everyone can use to feel more grounded and capable - and not beat themselves up in the process for not being &quot;tough enough&quot; in the first place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobyne believes that the language around resilience as &quot;fighting&quot; or being &quot;tougher&quot; is misguided; learning happens when we feel safe and trust, and fear and shame do not promote growth or change. In Awakened Resiliency, Robyne maps out a kinder approach to taking on the challenges of life and developing authentic self-alignment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobyne focuses on personal development practices that are research informed, sustainable, and attainable. She identifies the obstacles that derail us and keep us stuck, wondering - Why does life feel so hard? Why do so many of us seem to live in a constant state of strife and chaos?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobyne has identified five interconnected pillars that are universal across cultures and backgrounds: Belonging, Perspective, Acceptance, Hope and Humour. These pillars form a person&#39;s capacity for resilient behaviours, despite life&#39;&#39;s challenges. She then introduces you to the Resiliency Trajectory Model by showing you resiliency in action, through stories, research and practical strategies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlending the grounded science of classic books on resiliency like Grit . by Angela Lee Duckworth and Resilient by Rick Hanson, with the warmth and psychological insight of Brene Brown&#39;&#39;s Gifts of Imperfection, this book offers a refreshing take on everyday practices that support resiliency. Robyne shows the reader that you are truly capable, and that being okay (rather than better) is enough.</p>",

Although she began training as a speed skater, her coach encouraged her to pursue cycling. Clara excelled at cycling and won Olympic medals. However, she went back to her original dream of speed skating and won Olympic medals in that sport as well. She was the first athlete to compete in and win medals in both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Clara decided to give back by working with youth at risk and providing opportunities for children to play sports.

And she is not afraid to give Canadians what they need most &ndash; straight talk on how to deconstruct Canada&#39;s dark colonial legacy and embrace a new era of recognition and reconciliation</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this powerful book, drawn from Wilson-Raybould&rsquo;s speeches and other writings, she urges all Canadians &ndash; both Indigenous and non-Indigenous &ndash; to build upon the momentum already gained in the reconciliation process or risk hard-won progress being lost. The choice is stark: support Indigenous-led initiatives for Nation rebuilding or continue to allow governments to just &ldquo;manage the problem.&rdquo; She also argues that true reconciliation will never occur unless governments transcend barriers enshrined in the Indian Act that continue to deny Indigenous Peoples their rights. Until then, we&rsquo;ll be stuck in the status quo &ndash; mired in conflicts and court cases that do nothing to improve people&rsquo;s lives or heal the country.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe good news is that Indigenous Nations already have the solutions. But now is time to act and build a shared postcolonial future based on the foundations of trust, cooperation, recognition, and good governance.

Inspired by the example of her grandmother, who persevered throughout her life to keep alive the governing traditions of her people, and raised as the daughter of a hereditary chief and Indigenous leader, Wilson-Raybould always knew she would take on leadership roles and responsibilities. She never anticipated, however, that those roles would lead to a journey from her home community of We Wai Kai in British Columbia to Ottawa as Canada&#39;s first Indigenous Minister of Justice and Attorney General in the Cabinet of then newly elected prime minister, Justin Trudeau.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWilson-Raybould&#39;s experience in Trudeau&#39;s Cabinet reveals important lessons about how we must continue to strengthen our political institutions and culture, and the changes we must make to meet challenges such as racial justice and climate change. As her initial optimism about the possibilities of enacting change while in Cabinet shifted to struggles over inclusivity, deficiencies of political will, and concerns about adherence to core principles of our democracy, Wilson-Raybould stood on principle and, ultimately, resigned. In standing her personal and professional ground and telling the truth in front of the nation, Wilson-Raybould demonstrated the need for greater independence and less partisanship in how we govern.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Indian&quot; in the Cabinet: Speaking Truth to Power is the story of why Wilson-Raybould got into federal politics, her experience as an Indigenous leader sitting around the Cabinet table, her proudest achievements, the very public SNC-Lavalin affair, and how she got out and moved forward. Now sitting as an Independent Member in Parliament, Wilson-Raybould believes there is a better way to govern and a better way for politics--one that will make a better country for all.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>",

Four years later, she was proud to carry the Canadian flag at the head of the Canadian team as they participated in the opening ceremony of the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games. But there&rsquo;s another story behind her celebrated career as an athlete, behind her signature billboard smile.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile most professional athletes devote their entire lives to training, Clara spent her teenage years using drugs and drinking to escape the stifling home life her alcoholic father had created in Elmwood, Winnipeg. She was headed nowhere fast when, at sixteen, she watched transfixed in her living room as gold medal speed skater Ga&eacute;tan Boucher effortlessly raced in the 1988 Calgary Olympics. Dreaming of one day competing herself, Clara channeled her anger, frustration, and raw ambition into the endurance sports of speed skating and cycling. By 2010, she had become a six-time Olympic champion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut after more than a decade in the grueling world of professional sports that stripped away her confidence and bruised her body, Clara began to realize that her physical extremes, her emotional setbacks, and her partying habits were masking a severe depression. After winning bronze in the last speed skating race of her career, she decided to retire, determined to repair herself. She has emerged as one of our most committed humanitarians, advocating for a variety of social causes both in Canada and around the world. In 2010, she became national spokesperson for Bell Canada&rsquo;s Let&rsquo;s Talk campaign in support of mental health awareness, using her Olympic standing to share the positive message of the power of forgiveness.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTold with honesty and passion, Open Heart, Open Mind is Clara&rsquo;s personal journey through physical and mental pain to a life where love and understanding can thrive.

Ten years on, she was CEO, poised to grow the business into one of Canada&rsquo;s largest independently owned marketing firms. Today, as a co-star of the CBC TV hit Dragons&rsquo; Den, she is one of the country&rsquo;s most sought-after female entrepreneurs. The secret of her journey from poverty to the corner office?

Harper, Canada&#39;s 22nd Prime Minister, draws on a decade of experience as a G-7 leader to help leaders in business and government understand, adapt, and thrive in an age of unprecedented disruption.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe world is in flux. Disruptive technologies, ideas, and politicians are challenging business models, norms, and political conventions everywhere. How we, as leaders in business and politics, choose to respond matters greatly. Some voices refuse to concede the need for any change, while others advocate for radical realignment. But neither of these positions can sustainably address the legitimate concerns of disaffected citizens.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRight Here, Right Now sets out a pragmatic, forward-looking vision for leaders in business and politics by analyzing how economic, social, and public policy trends--including globalized movements of capital, goods and services, and labour--have affected our economies, communities, and governments.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHarper contends that Donald Trump&#39;s surprise election and governing agenda clearly signal that political, economic, and social institutions must be more responsive to legitimate concerns about public policy, market regulation, immigration, and technology.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUrging readers to look past questions of style and gravitas, Harper thoughtfully examines the substantive underpinnings of how and why Donald Trump was able to succeed Barack Obama as President of the United States, and how these forces are manifesting themselves in other western democracies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnalyzing international trade, market regulation, immigration, technology, and the role of government in the digital economy, Harper lays out the case for pragmatic leadership as a proven solution to the uncertainty and risk that businesses and governments face today.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tThis book tackles one of the big problems employers face today: finding and keeping the best employees, especially at a time when young workers typically quit after only three years on the job. Rethink Work stands out from other books in this category because the author is one of those young people: 24-year-old Eric Termuende, a rising star on the international speakers circuit. Instead of relying on the well-tread but often misguided notions that emerge from surveys, Termuende writes about the actual experiences of young people on the job. The result is a refreshing look at the workplace today.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo keep the best employees, companies need to focus not on what they do, but how they do it, with whom they do it, and why. This will be the true differentiator for companies in the future.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTermuende&rsquo;s advice is soothingly old fashioned. This young writer says it&rsquo;s time to put away the devices, at least part of the time, and start talking face to face with other people in the office. What young people want is human connection, and when they have it, they will perform at a high level and stay loyal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t​This means treating people like the individuals they are, not as stereotypes&mdash;such as so-called Millennials, who are typically branded by their elders as being entitled. It means talking with each other, not texting. The workplace of the future, in other words, will restore the value of old-fashioned human relationships.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\r\n\tCanada&#39;s most popular military leader since the Second World War tells his own story about our soldiers at war. In the summer of 2008, General Rick Hillier resigned his command as Chief of the Defence Staff of the Canadian Forces. You could almost hear the sigh of relief in Ottawa as Canada&#39;s most popular, and most controversial, leader since the Second World War left a role in which he&#39;d been as frank-speaking, as unpredictable, and as resolutely apolitical as any military leader this country has ever seen.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBorn and raised in Newfoundland, Hillier joined the military as a young man and quickly climbed the ranks. He played a significant role in domestic challenges, such as the 1998 ice story that paralyzed much of eastern Ontario and Quebec, and he quickly became a player on the international scene, commanding an American corps in Texas and a multinational NATO task force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But it was his role as General Rick Hillier, Canada&#39;s Chief of the Defence Staff, that defined him as a Canadian public figure. In Afghanistan, Canada faced its first combat losses since the Korean War and every casualty suddenly became front-page news. A country formerly ambivalent or even angry about its role in the conflict suddenly became gripped by the drama playing out not only in the war zone of a country half-way around the world, but in the unfriendly conference rooms in the country&#39;s capital as Hillier pulled no punches, demanding more funding and more troops and more appreciation for the women and men fighting a war on foreign soil.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;A Soldier First&quot; is a hard-hitting, frank account of Hillier&#39;s role in his own words. The man who never backed down from the Taliban or Canada&#39;s top political leaders tells all in what will be one of the most important books to come out of this country this decade.</p>",

Hockey Hall of Famer. All while raising a child, earning multiple university degrees, and not benefiting from the financial stability male professional athletes have. She gave the game everything she had&mdash;now, Hayley shares what the game gave her.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom motherhood to pro leagues to her new career in medicine, Hayley shares the hard-won lessons she learned on and off the ice that helped her not only have a record-breaking hockey career but craft a life filled with joy, growth, and challenges. In her own words, Hayley shares how she rose from the backyard pond and changing in boiler rooms (because girls&#39; dressing rooms didn&rsquo;t exist) to Olympic MVP (twice). How becoming a parent made her a better athlete. How she learned to thrive under monumental pressure. But she doesn&rsquo;t stop at revealing the pillars to her tremendous success&mdash;Hayley delves into her immense failures and how she grew from them. Like Kobe Bryant, Tom Brady, and Abby Wambach before her, Hayley shares her wisdom through personal stories of triumph, relentlessness, and more than a couple confrontations. Told with humour, compassion, and steadfast optimism, Hayley&rsquo;s practical advice, coaching, and invaluable perspective inspires readers to never accept &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not the way we do things&rdquo; or &ldquo;that hasn&rsquo;t been done before&rdquo; as limitations. An empowering and pragmatic guide, Hayley encourages readers to not follow in her footsteps, but to carve their own ice.</p>",
